Brown",5,"Best Breastfeeding Supplement Out There!!!","I have been using More Milk Plus for three months now and started using it when my son was a couple of weeks old. My first son fussed while nursing causing me to be frustrated with it and pumping upon returning to work was stressful. I nursed him until he was a year and couldn't wait to be done with it. My three month old doesn't have a problem at all nursing, every three hours my breasts are full and ready to nurse, I pump every morning to store additional milk (I'm now up to 200 oz. in the freezer) and I take More Milk Plus three times a day. I will not stop taking the supplement for fear of my supply decreasing. Anyone out there looking for something to help, this is your answer. The taste is pretty bad but mixed with 1-2 oz of OJ make it bearable.

It seemed to work reasonably well, with a moderate increase in production (maybe an extra ~1.5oz/double pumping session). However, it had an unexpected effect on my thyroid as well!I am mildly hypothyroid and have been very stable on medication for several years. I had been taking this stuff for a couple of months when the time came for a routine check-up lab test. To my surprise, that test revealed that I was mildly _hyper_-thyroid. I attributed it to general hormonal issues with pregnancy, post-partum, nursing, etc. because I couldn't find any information linking any of the ingredients to thyroid function. But my endocrinologist insisted that herbal preparations can have unpredictable effects, so I went off the stuff. Six weeks later all my lab tests were normal again.I don't want to be too critical of this product because I think it actually helps a little, but I really want to note this effect.

The strong phenol anti-oxidants destroy pathogenic bacteria, viruses and yeasts. This super herb is very rich in anti-oxidant phytochemical flavonoids and phenolic acids.

I like it because it is easy to put on, comfortable to wear, and best of all, it works. The ""pressure spot"" built into the band must be placed over the affected tendon just in front of the painful spot. The pressure spot creates a new fulcrum for the tendon and allows the damaged portion to rest and heal. I have severe ""tennis elbow"" and this allows me to function and do things (even play limited tennis) as the tendon heals. It must be tight to be effective, for it must place adequate pressure on the tendon in order to work. I wear an ace bandage beneath the support so that I can cinch the support tighter and not pinch the skin.One universal rule in healing any injury is to stop doing anything that hurts the injured area. Do not try to go through the pain, it will just make the injury worse and set back the healing time. Therefore, if an activity is causing pain, even while wearing the support, stop doing that activity and let time pass to allow for healing. Tendonitis injuries heal very slowly, some taking as long as a year to heal. Be patient, do something else to stay active, but above all, don't irritate the tendon!Thisis a good effective product at an affordable price.kone","{0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0.75, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1.6, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0.75, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0.95, 0, 0, 0, 1.15, 0, 0, 0, 1.6, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, -0.6, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, -0.3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, -0.95, 0, 0, -0.6, 0, 0.55, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, -0.95, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, -0.8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0.7, -0.45, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1.05, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0.45, -0.6, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0.85, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0.85, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, -0.9, 0, 0, -0.6, 0, 0, 0, -1.05, 0, -0.85, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, -1.15, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, -0.9, -1.05, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, -1.15, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0.85, -0.6, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0.45, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0.85, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1.998, 0, 0, 0, 2.85, 3.15, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0}",0.904,0.142,0.749,0.109,1,1,1325,245

I researched alternatives to the floss and found these, also researched the proper way to brush teeth and started using the total care mouthwash. My gums stopped bleeding after about a month of using these and I would use the regular floss about twice a month just to get a little more thorough removal of junk in there.

Don't get me wrong, it is definitely an expensive purchase. However, the money was well spent. My husband and I went through a considerable amount of trouble in regards to our children and trying to determine if they were truly having fevers. For a period of about 6 months, our kids were having fevers ranging from a low grade, to a true textbook definition of having a fever. Well, we were under the impression that they were. We have made several trips to the doctor's office, even switching pediatricians a few times in order to try to figure out what was going on. We were using an Exergen thermometer (which our doctor's office used)that continuously showed higher temperatures. Now, I'm not knocking the thermometer, in fact, it's helped us during other incidents of true fevers. But, based on what our pediatricians kept saying, the only way to get an accurate temperature reading is with a rectal temp. Now, the basic rectal thermometers that can be purchased at local pharmacies/walmart/target/etc never work for us.

Thank goodness this was not the first one I ever got or I might not have tried again.What attracted me was that it is waterproof which has been an occasional lifesaver for shower time. I would normally not want the controls on the base though so I really don't want to even look at this option if I'm anywhere dry. I find it awkward to have to reach like that when adjustment is needed on intensity/speed. I also notice that the weight of the batteries at the base of the device requires more attention from me to keep the fun where it needs to be. In my other rabbits, having the control and battery pack as a separated portion allows me to easily and naturally deal with any sudden need to change the action in a comfortable position. It also makes the business end easier to handle, prop,maneuver, etc since it doesn't have all the extra baggage and weight at the base.The girth is a bit gluttonous for my tastes but it's not unmanageable. The beads inside look and sound a bit too scary and have not actually felt worthwhile to me. The ability to change direction has no appeal for me either but perhaps if someone is using the tip of the shaft for some foreplay this could be useful. I don't find it to be soft enough or set for a proper path to make that interesting with this device though. Other rabbits of more modest size have definitely delivered larger return though.The ears are too stiff and sometimes can hurt if not careful. ...and really, how careful can you remain when you are trying to let go and ""enjoy?"" For me, perhaps it's a YMMV thing, the ears also don't naturally land where they should when the other business aspect is where it needs to be. This requires some odd posturing and holding but it can be done to the desired end result. I have to emphasize that even when that result is achieved, my other rabbits give a higher quality reward and often in less time unless I purposely played it to last longer.Out of the package, the smell was really strong and surprised me since I had never noticed this in others I've gotten. It did not fade quickly in spite of repeated washing and even now it still smells ""industrial.""I would not buy this model again so hopefully I'll find a better waterproof rabbit option next time.","{0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1.7465, 0, 0, 0.75, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0.9, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1.4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, -0.111, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, -0.2139895, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, -0.3, 0, 0, 0, 0.05, 0.75, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1.15, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0.7, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1.15, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0.9, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, -3.3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, -1.554, 0, 0, 0, 1.95, 0, 0, 0, 0, -1.8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2.85, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2.55, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2.55, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, -3.6, 0, 0, -0.666, 0, 0, 0, 1.317525, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3.3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, -1.95, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1.65, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 4.05, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2.1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3.8895, 0, 1.74555, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, -3.6, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2.9895, 0, 0, 0, 2.85, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0}",0.99,0.14,0.805,0.055,3,0,2325,431

First there is the STRONG unpleasant odor that it has itself very chemically and gross! I washed it with 2 different soaps prior to use and it still made my hands and other parts smell like it! That killed me and my husbands kink for the night. Secondly the levels on the motors that make the metal beads run around arent all that different from first to 3rd its barely noticeable when change it. I basically tossed money down the drain because I cant get over the stink of the thing to use it again and I am pretty sure I wont be buying products from this company again out of fear the rest are like this!

Sure you cant return a product once its used but someone shouldnt sell a product that isnt good in the first place. I'm sure they all knew about the smell. I am sure there are testers they use...

However, this is VERY quiet, I would say if you want to use it on the top speeds (although I haven't found the need to use it above the first) maybe have something like a desk fan to cover the sound if you want to keep it undetected. The twisting motion of the head can be a little more noticeable than the vibrating bullet, it's almost like a power drill on low, but it's muted. Again, anything above the first, you might wanna have some cover up.Also, something that wasn't covered in the description (if it was, I didn't see it): There's a panel with an increase button and decrease button for vibration and rotation of the head separately, so you can have all vibration, or a little of both, or just the rotation (there's also a button to switch the direction of the rotation) and at low, medium or high.I personally prefer more of an thrusting experience, so this probably won't be my favorite toy.

Since they are attached to rotating rods they don't stop moving when they come into contact with you. In vibrators that have loose beads, when the beads become depressed by the vaginal walls they sometimes stop moving. They are no longer stimulating the vaginal opening.

It is very pliable and has raised bumps below the head on the opposite side of the bunny. It is approximately 5 inches in circumference. It has three levels of intensity and the head rotates. It does not thrust, it rotates around in a lopsided circle. There are 9 ball bearing in the shaft that go around in a circle. You can change the rotation from clockwise to counter-clockwise. Why change the direction of the rotation? I do not know.The bunny is approximately 4 1/2 inches in length at its longest point, which is the base of the machine to its ears. On the short side, the bunny is about 2 1/2 inches in length. The bunny ears are pliable and separate, and the bunny has a pointy nose. There is a bullet inside the bunny. The bunny also has three levels of intensity.I like the rotation of the shaft and the thickness. The intensity in not bad, not earth shattering, but not bad. Here's the down side. I just don't get the bunny. If the ears are supposed to be the stimulation, the distance between the end of the ears and the end of the shaft are 2 3/4 inches. If I am supposed to use the bunny's ears to tickle my clitoris, then I can only insert 2 3/4 inches of the shaft. If the nose is supposed to be the stimulation, then I can only insert 3 1/2 inches of the shaft to feel the bunny's nose. If the bullet is the stimulation, then I have about 2 inches of bunny ears & nose keeping my clitoris away from the bullet. Because the bunny is attached to the shaft at five inches, there is no way that I can insert more than that, but when I do insert 5 inches, the bunny is way above my clitoris and uncomfortable. I read one comment that stated that she cut the ears of the bunny off. That may help, but not I'm not trying that...yet.The next concern is the rotation. You have to have a firm grip on the device for the rotation to work. It you insert the vibrator and hold it at the base, the head rotates. However, if you do not hold the vibrator tightly, the base rotates while the head stays fixed. Again, weird workings.I suggest that you look at this in a retail store. When you see it in person, you will understand what I mean about the bunny's ears & nose being too high up the shaft. If you love the bunny and only want 2 3/4 to 3 1/2 inches of shaft, this may be the toy for you. Unfortunately, I am still looking for Mr. Right Vibrator.","{0, 0, 0, 0, 0.35, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0.35, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0.75, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0.925, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2.775, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, -1.8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, -2.4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, -1.65, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2.55, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, -1.05, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 4.8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0.45, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, -2.1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0}",0.714,0.039,0.936,0.026,3,0,2694,527

Jones ""JuiciJ""",4,"Play like Bunnies","The Waterproof Jack Rabbit Vibrator is a dual action vibrator. One motor for clitoral stimulation and one motor for vaginal stimulation. The classic ""rabbit"" design. I haven't tested its claim of being waterproof by taking it in the hot-tub, but don't worry I will!The penis shaped design is supposed to make penetration and thrusting easier, however it is bigger than most vibrators so be prepared with lubrication. The nice thing about this vibrator is that it is made with jelly so you can use water or silicone based lubrication. The jelly also makes it flexible. I found this to be a downside in that it didn't hit my g-spot as well as other dual action vibrators. A plus side is the vibrator's rotating tip that gyrates in circles to tease your vagina and the massaging beads that allow the vibrator head to roll and rub against your G-spot for stimulation.The ""rabbit ears"" tickle and tease your clit if you can get them positioned correctly. I found the push button control pad to be bulky and hard to use in the ""heat of the moment"". You get to select from 3 different Rotation and Vibration Speeds or push a button to reverse the spin completely.It uses 3 AA batteries, which is goes through quite quickly. Have plenty on hand. It comes in clear, pink or purple.Once you get past the bulkiness and large size and figure out how to use the control pad of the Jack Rabbit it can produce some great orgasms.

I purchased this walker because I loved the fact that there was no assembly and it had a ""cool"" look to it. It definitely looked different from most.This thing is the SUV of walkers. It's not feather light but it certainly is sturdy. There is no assembly required and you simply pull it out of it's large box and go. One push of a lever and the rollator collapses (folds) vertically so that it can fit easily in a trunk or back seat. The wheels are large and smooth and this thing actually handles curbs and grass and changes of terrain easily. It's rough and tough and looks like it can take a beating and handle abuse pretty well.The seating is very comfortable and this rollator adjusts easily (arm height) with simple lever pushes. There are no brake cables or anything to assemble. It's ready to go out of the box and that is one of the reasons I chose it. I also bought this one because it looked a little different (resembles a baby carriage more than a traditional rollator or walker).It drives smoothly, is easy to operate and is extremely comfortable.

We both go to the Chiropractor and have the Mediflow Waterbased pillows (see my review for those and the pillow case) but the addition of these 2 items was a great investment. We both suffer from neck and back pain and arthritis so we have tried many different things to help ease our pain and discomfort.My husband has used the NeckEase several times already and I used it the other night...heated it in the micro, wrapped it around my neck and climbed into bed for the night. Was very comfortable laying there with my head on my Mediflow Waterbased pillow and before I knew it I was fast asleep!I've used the Sinus Pillow twice now. We live in West TN and this time of year we can have some crazy weather - in the 70s one day and down to the 40s the next. This weather wreaks havoc on my sinuses, causing me lots of sinus pain and pressure and some pretty strong and painful, pounding headaches. I just heat my Sinus Pillow in the micro for the recommended time, lay down and place it over my eyes and nose and once again, it's not long until I'm fast asleep. Now, I'm not going to say it took my headache away completely each time, but it sure does relieve the sinus pressure and greatly reduces the pounding pain in my head so that I can relax and fall asleep quite easily. The various scents given off from each pillow is wonderful and very soothing.I would recommend both of these products and look forward to using them for years. And after reading the reviews of the BodySense Large Pack and Extra Large Pack I am putting those on my wishlist for purchase of one or both in the very near future!","{0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0.85, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 4.65, 0, 0, 0, -3.75, 0, 0, 0, 0, -3.45, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2.55, 2.25, 0, -3.45, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3.8895, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, -2.1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, -4.35, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, -3.45, 0, -1.8, 0, 0, 3.3, 3.45, 0, -2.85, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1.2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1.95, 0, 2.25, 0, 0, -1.8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, -3.45, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2.85, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2.5395, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 4.05, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2.64555, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0}",0.916,0.133,0.766,0.101,2,3,1761,332

Their ability to add a whole new dimension to the ambience and conversation of a given party never fails to impress either the host or the guests. My only issue with the Litecubes is that once their batteries run out (about 8 to 12 hours depending on storage and usage conditions), you have no choice but to dispose of them and purchase replacements (which can get rather expensive if you own several sets of them in different colors like I do) since it is not possible to reseal the watertight plastic casing that houses the batteries. It would have been nice if they had designed them so that the batteries could recharged by placing the litecubes on a charger base of some kind, which would solve the power capacity issue for the most part without having to physically remove the batteries.

NO! NO! it just does not work. first of all, there is NO round end of the screwdriver. 2nd, even if there was, there is just NO WAY you could hope to hold down a completely smooth and rounded end of a very little screw, so it could be tightened. to be fair, some of the screws did have slots, but the longer ones DID NOT. the long ones were the only ones that I needed, so this purchase was a complete waste of time & $. I would never order anything else from this store. if they would sell this, then you can not trust them. they obviously got an order of screws that were defective & are trying to get rid of them. just think about it.

No wheat, no gluten, no soybeans, no dairy, no egg, no fish/shellfish, no peanuts/tree nuts.The products works quickly and effectively. It calls for two (2) tablespoons. I took barely ONE tablespoon and it worked within a few hours. The Flaxseed meal releases oils, the defatted chia bran is a fairly aggressive fiber, but the orange pulp and peel, full of natural anti-oxidants and bioflavoids is a key ingredient. Orange pulp is a digestive stimulant and encourages and increased the soft muscle contractions of the intestines, thus encouraging the forward movement of the bowel content. Orange pulp and peel is used in chinese medicine for the same thing - increasing digestion among other things.The taste is slightly strong (slightly bitter due to the orange peel) and it is a lot easier to get down than psyllium.

We both go to the Chiropractor and have the Mediflow Waterbased pillows (see my review for those and the pillow case) but the addition of these 2 items was a great investment. We both suffer from neck and back pain and arthritis so we have tried many different things to help ease our pain and discomfort.My husband has used the NeckEase several times already and I used it the other night...heated it in the micro, wrapped it around my neck and climbed into bed for the night. Was very comfortable laying there with my head on my Mediflow Waterbased pillow and before I knew it I was fast asleep!I've used the Sinus Pillow twice now. We live in West TN and this time of year we can have some crazy weather - in the 70s one day and down to the 40s the next. This weather wreaks havoc on my sinuses, causing me lots of sinus pain and pressure and some pretty strong and painful, pounding headaches. I just heat my Sinus Pillow in the micro for the recommended time, lay down and place it over my eyes and nose and once again, it's not long until I'm fast asleep. Now, I'm not going to say it took my headache away completely each time, but it sure does relieve the sinus pressure and greatly reduces the pounding pain in my head so that I can relax and fall asleep quite easily. The various scents given off from each pillow is wonderful and very soothing.I would recommend both of these products and look forward to using them for years.

So, you can use this in the winter or summer or anytime heat/cold is needed.To heat, put in the microwave for 2 to 3 minutes. To cool, keep in freezer until needed. You may want to put this in a plastic bag first if storing in the freezer.Over the years, the aromatic spices and herbs seem to retain their scent and the rice never seems to dry out, which is quite amazing.Ingredients: Rice, cinnamon, cloves, allspice and black pepper.This truly will relax tense shoulders when heated in the microwave.

Over the last couple of years, the pain in my hands has become more disruptive, and I've tried several things in my search for relief. Prescription medications (oral), OTC topical creams, heated wraps and gloves (both compression and non-compression). I purchased two of these Futuro Energizing Support gloves and have been mostly satisfied...but not completely.As you can see from the product image, these gloves do not cover the fingers at all, and therefore the ""warmth"" benefit is limited to the palm of the hand. This is better than nothing, of course. There is certainly a benefit from the compression provided by the glove, but once again, this is limited to the wrist and the palm of the hand.On the plus side, the gloves are reversible -- able to be worn on either hand. I find I am not able to wear them for long periods of time, however...the piece that goes between the index and middle finger becomes uncomfortable and I find myself tugging at it. Also, the velcro strap that wraps around the wrist is quick to snag and pull at the fabric of the glove if you aren't careful. (Although I am quite careful to keep the strap fastened to itself even when I'm not wearing the gloves, I've got a couple of unsightly pulls on each glove.)I can recommend these gloves when you are looking for some compression (as long as you don't care about coverage for the fingers), and they are definitely great for wrist support thanks to the velcro strap, but I prefer the IMAK Arthritis gloves in general. Keep the Futuro gloves as a back up pair.","{0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, -1.15, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, -0.7965, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1.05, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0.85, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 0, -0.45, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1.1, 0, 0, 0.95, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0.7, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, -1.35, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, -1.8, 0, 0, 3.3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, -2.4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, -0.666, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1.3395, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2.25, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, -2.442, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2.55, 4.65, 0, 0, 2.55, 2.85, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0}",0.975,0.136,0.806,0.059,2,0,1603,290

I have to routinely grade many papers, so writing a lot is necessary. During those times, the tendonitis in my hand gets pretty bad, it's painful to even hold a fork, and on the worst days I can feel it all the time even when I'm not holding something.I've tried many things--more ergonomic set-ups, different kids of pens, other braces, hand stretches, but this has worked best of all. It allows full hand motion unlike the thick braces.Perhaps I'm lucky that my hand size is good for this glove/brace. It puts a good amount of pressure on my palms. I'm unfamiliar with the biology behind the pain, but that ""squeeze"" seems to work, especially when combined with a little Icy Hot balm (don't use the cream or gel with it as it's too messy). The glove is stretchy and could probably accommodate a range of hand sizes, but I imagine that if your hand is too small or exactly in the middle of two sizes, it might not work well. Give it a try though.The only complaint I have is that the part in between the index finger and palm has a tendency to stretch and become thinner, even if the rest of the glove/brace doesn't stretch that much. As a result, you will have to replace your glove regularly if you use it often.Still, the price of the glove is nothing compared to the benefits that it brings and the ability it's given me to grade so many papers without pain.","{0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1.1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, -0.2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1.1, 0, 1.1, -1.25, 0, -0.95, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, -1.55, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1.1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 4.8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3.3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2.7, 0, 0, 3.3, 0, 0, 2.85, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2.85, 0, 0, -1.8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, -3.45, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, -2.25, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3.3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3.3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, -1.221, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, -1.8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2.4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1.95, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2.553}",0.986,0.163,0.765,0.072,3,0,1471,276

We both go to the Chiropractor and have the Mediflow Waterbased pillows (see my review for those and the pillow case) but the addition of these 2 items was a great investment. We both suffer from neck and back pain and arthritis so we have tried many different things to help ease our pain and discomfort.My husband has used the NeckEase several times already and I used it the other night...heated it in the micro, wrapped it around my neck and climbed into bed for the night. Was very comfortable laying there with my head on my Mediflow Waterbased pillow and before I knew it I was fast asleep!I've used the Sinus Pillow twice now. We live in West TN and this time of year we can have some crazy weather - in the 70s one day and down to the 40s the next. This weather wreaks havoc on my sinuses, causing me lots of sinus pain and pressure and some pretty strong and painful, pounding headaches. I just heat my Sinus Pillow in the micro for the recommended time, lay down and place it over my eyes and nose and once again, it's not long until I'm fast asleep. Now, I'm not going to say it took my headache away completely each time, but it sure does relieve the sinus pressure and greatly reduces the pounding pain in my head so that I can relax and fall asleep quite easily. The various scents given off from each pillow is wonderful and very soothing.I would recommend both of these products and look forward to using them for years. And after reading the reviews of the BodySense Large Pack and Extra Large Pack I am putting those on my wishlist for purchase of one or both in the very near future!","{0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0.85, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 4.65, 0, 0, 0, -3.75, 0, 0, 0, 0, -3.45, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2.55, 2.25, 0, -3.45, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3.8895, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, -2.1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, -4.35, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, -3.45, 0, -1.8, 0, 0, 3.3, 3.45, 0, -2.85, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1.2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1.95, 0, 2.25, 0, 0, -1.8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, -3.45, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2.85, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2.5395, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 4.05, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2.64555, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0}",0.916,0.133,0.766,0.101,2,3,1761,332

It just wasn't for me.","{0, 0, 0, -0.55, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, -0.6, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, -0.6, 0, 0, 0, 0, -0.45, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, -0.95, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, -0.45, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0.75, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0.85, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2.85, 0, 2.4, 0, 0, 2.85, 0, 0, 0, 3.4395, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0.3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0}",0.943,0.107,0.845,0.048,1,4,930,183

My daughter has actually had less milk production since shes started using it. After weeks of hopeing it would start working she has completely quit using it and has thrown it away.

Since I am over 175 lbs I had to take the larger dose. I came close to throwing up when I took it, even if I took a sip of water to wash it down I dry heaved for about 15 minutes after. But I figured it would be worth it. Well a week later and I am still struggling with my milk output and my stomach is in knots all day from this stuff (I hear it can cause stomach upset)I was taking Fenugreek before with decent results but needed more so I thought this would help, I think I got better results with Fenugreek now that I think about it. With this, I dont even get the ""maple syrup smell"" that you are supposed to get (this is how you know you are taking enough and it is active in your system).Another review suggested that this product seems to work better for skinny moms below 175, maybe that is the case, because it didn't work for me either.I will be switching back to Fenugreek today. What a waste of $30!!!!Maybe the health food store I bought it from will allow me to return it? Who knows.","{0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0.35, 0, 0, 0, 1.8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, -4.1895, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1.35, 0, 1.65, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, -2.7, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2.55, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2.85, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2.55, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2.85, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, -2.7, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1.35, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0}",0.917,0.112,0.837,0.051,3,5,1118,221
