It seemed to work reasonably well, with a moderate increase in production (maybe an extra ~1.5oz/double pumping session). However, it had an unexpected effect on my thyroid as well!I am mildly hypothyroid and have been very stable on medication for several years. I had been taking this stuff for a couple of months when the time came for a routine check-up lab test. To my surprise, that test revealed that I was mildly _hyper_-thyroid. I attributed it to general hormonal issues with pregnancy, post-partum, nursing, etc. because I couldn't find any information linking any of the ingredients to thyroid function. But my endocrinologist insisted that herbal preparations can have unpredictable effects, so I went off the stuff. Six weeks later all my lab tests were normal again.I don't want to be too critical of this product because I think it actually helps a little, but I really want to note this effect. Please remember that I am simply reporting my personal experiences and not the results of a scientific study, but if you know that you have thyroid issues you might want to have some extra testing done if you choose to use this product.","{0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, -0.85, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0.55, 0, 0, 0, 0.65, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0.7465, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0.55, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, -0.333, 0, 0, 0, -1.95, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2.4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0.8895, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1.95, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0.45, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0}",0.81,0.073,0.9,0.027,3,1,1254,219

Great stuff!!!!!I was told the enormous benifit of Oregano: it is one of the most powerful healing herbs and natural anti-biotics ever studied. It has been found in a recent study to be significantly better than all of the 18 currently used anti-biotics in the treatment of MRSA staph infections. The strong phenol anti-oxidants destroy pathogenic bacteria, viruses and yeasts. This super herb is very rich in anti-oxidant phytochemical flavonoids and phenolic acids. It is the third highest herb in oxygen radical absorbancy capacity (ORAC) with an impressive score of 200,129. The USDA ranks oregano's antioxidant capacity anywhere from 3 to 20 times higher than any other herb.You can see 2 bottles Oreganol P73 in my fridge.

This oil healed and soothed my throat almost instantly, and feel great up to now.

And my sister recommended I also try olive leaf extract for the same purpose.Prior to using these products, I would get about 2-3 colds a year for as long as I can remember. The first symptom would be general fatigue, followed by a sore throat, a runny and/or stuffy nose, then coughing and congestion. The mild symptoms would last about 1.5 weeks, but unfortunately sometimes the congestion would linger for weeks.Then I started taking the oregano oil and olive leaf extract. What I've discovered over the past 5 years is this. If I start taking these herbal supplements when I start getting a sore throat, then usually I never get any chest congestion. In addition, any symptoms I do have are generally milder. So for the past 5 years, I've only had 3 serious colds, and one of those was linked to allergies (I live in Central Texas, and cedar allergies are common, although I'm not usually severely affected by them). Prior to taking these herbal supplements, I would have averaged about 10 colds in a 5 year time span.To achieve my results, I take 1 oregano pill and 1 olive leaf pill with every meal, 3 times daily, as soon as I detect the initial symptoms (usually for me it is a sore throat). I continue this intake for about 5 days, which is usually when the soreness in my throat subsides.Overall, I'm SERIOUSLY pleased with my results.

Lee ""DIYer""",3,"Works, but somewhat uncomfortable","I'm wearing this thing as I type. I've had tendinitis in both elbows for about the last 10 years now. Hurt my back a couple of years ago and stopped being active entirely for a year in exercises that require the use of arms (lifting weights, basketball, racquet sports). The pain mostly went away, except that I still felt it a little bit of an ache whenever I flexed the gripping muscles. So I started exercising and playing sports again. Much to my chagrin, the pain came back in spite of taking care to warm up and stretch. Perhaps I did not do those things enough, but the pain returned very quickly. So I decided to try this support.My pain isn't debilitating. I can still play sports (in my case, basketball and badminton) fine, but the pain is always there.After a few hours of wearing the straps, I could feel some relief, which was very good. However, the edges of the strap that is in direct contact w/ my skin is a bit rough, and thus irritates my skin somewhat. Also, because the strap is the same for both arms, the buckle will also obstruct movement in one arm depending on whether you have golf or tennis elbow. I'm inclined to return this and try something else, but I'll probably give it a week and see if my condition improves some.Edit:I played around a little more with this thing and wanted to make a correction to my previous statements about the buckle (since I thought about it after I submitted my review). You can turn it around and the buckle will NOT end up on the inside of where the elbow bends. I was wrong about that. Still, it's not the most comfortable brace out there, and the rough edges still chafes my skin some.","{0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, -1.2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, -0.45, 0, 0.85, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, -1.15, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, -0.8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0.4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, -0.95, 0, -1.15, 0, 0, 0, -1.2, 0, 0, 1.1, 0, 0.45, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, -3.45, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, -3.45, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2.1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1.2, 0, 0, -3.45, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3.15, 0, 0, 0, 3.2895, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, -2.55, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2.7, 0, 2.1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, -3.15, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, -2.87823, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0}",-0.91,0.079,0.81,0.112,3,0,1650,305

I like it because it is easy to put on, comfortable to wear, and best of all, it works. The ""pressure spot"" built into the band must be placed over the affected tendon just in front of the painful spot. The pressure spot creates a new fulcrum for the tendon and allows the damaged portion to rest and heal. I have severe ""tennis elbow"" and this allows me to function and do things (even play limited tennis) as the tendon heals. It must be tight to be effective, for it must place adequate pressure on the tendon in order to work. I wear an ace bandage beneath the support so that I can cinch the support tighter and not pinch the skin.One universal rule in healing any injury is to stop doing anything that hurts the injured area. Do not try to go through the pain, it will just make the injury worse and set back the healing time. Therefore, if an activity is causing pain, even while wearing the support, stop doing that activity and let time pass to allow for healing. Tendonitis injuries heal very slowly, some taking as long as a year to heal. Be patient, do something else to stay active, but above all, don't irritate the tendon!Thisis a good effective product at an affordable price.kone","{0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0.75, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1.6, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0.75, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0.95, 0, 0, 0, 1.15, 0, 0, 0, 1.6, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, -0.6, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, -0.3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, -0.95, 0, 0, -0.6, 0, 0.55, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, -0.95, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, -0.8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0.7, -0.45, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1.05, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0.45, -0.6, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0.85, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0.85, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, -0.9, 0, 0, -0.6, 0, 0, 0, -1.05, 0, -0.85, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, -1.15, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, -0.9, -1.05, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, -1.15, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0.85, -0.6, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0.45, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0.85, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1.998, 0, 0, 0, 2.85, 3.15, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0}",0.904,0.142,0.749,0.109,1,1,1325,245

I suffer from pain in my forearms, just below the elbow. I also sometimes get pain on the outside, just above my elbow. The strap greatly helps both. I position the gel pad where it hurts on my forearm, and I instantly feel better (it's a very comforting feeling having support against that tendon). I find that by using these for a day or so (including overnight) at the first sign of a flare-up, I can often avert what used to be several weeks or months of mobility-limiting pain. I'm not sure if it's because the strap actually protects the tendon or if it's just because wearing the strap makes me acutely aware of overuse (a flexed tendon really strains against the strap), but whatever the case, it works for me. I've been using these for over a year now, and I haven't had an acute flare-up a single time once I resolved the flare-up I was having when I bought them. I initially needed to wear them most of the time for several weeks. Once I got better, I only needed them for a while every couple of weeks. Now I only need them every couple of months.I've never used other brands of straps, so I can't say how these compare, but these are comfortable, easy to use, and effective. My only complaint is that the Velcro goes all the way to the edge, so when I bend my arm, it can rub uncomfortably against my upper arm, but that's a fairly minor point.

I am about 5'10"" and nearly 200 lbs. Very active, but not a tennis player. I was cleaning my lawn with an electric leaf blower. It gets tiring, so I was switching between arms. The next day I decided to clean my hanger out with the wonderful blower. So imagine you are holding a heavy leaf blower in your left hand, and rotating it towards the left...the muscles, tendons and ligaments involved in that motion became the problem.These muscles were again recently damaged in an accident. They really never get time to heal, as it can take many months. And I was always banging my elbow in to things...So this brace, which is very robust and larger than the ace models, not only provides security for the muscles connections, but also keeps you from banging your elbow...which if you are reading this, know how it hurts.Within two days, I was able to regain the ability to make a clenched fist, and slowly reach for the shoulder belt without great pain. Scratching your back with a damaged elbow is tough, but I can now almost do it. I did a great deal of moving over the last few days (picking up rubber maid containers) and the pain is only moderate and occasional, vs continuous all day long.The pain was diagnosed by a local neurologist as referred pain caused by chronic compression of the C5-6 vertebra, which would probably need to be fused...hmmm.So, I am pleased to wear this brace rather than face spinal surgery.

Because of this, I've always made flossing a priority, but to be honest, I find it takes a lot of time and isn't really efficient, so I keep looking for alternatives. Over the years I've tried flossing handles, individual floss picks, etc., but never found anything that was an improvement or worked even as well as regular flossing. Until now. Based on an online review I picked up a box of these Brush Picks. I've been using them for a month, and I can say that I don't think I'll ever go back to regular floss. Not only is it easier to care for my teeth with these picks, I think they actually do a better job than floss.","{0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, -1.05, 0, 0, -0.85, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0.95, 0, 0, 1.05, 0, 0, 0, 0.75, 0, 0, 1.1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3.45, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, -2.32323, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1.65, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2.7, 0, 3.3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2.85, 0, 0, 0}",0.974,0.172,0.788,0.04,2,0,807,154

They are a flat bristle molded as part of the toothpick. So much the better! I wondered how they could be so cheap. They are simply molded plastic toothpicks with tiny flexible tines on the other end. Oh, and the pick side has a few small ridges on the flattened sides, for clearing plaque.Let me tell you: THEY ARE AWESOME!!!My wife and kids thought I was crazy when I started to rave about these things. They are perfect for anyone who maintains some pretty regular oral hygiene. You can get out the toughest of food particles or stringy fibers!OK, it's true. The toothpick end is knife-shaped: sharp at the point and pretty rigid. But, I think that is one the best features! This shape allows you to insert the pick into the gaps of teeth, right at the gum line, and clean both teeth with a few passes, in & out. The fact that the pick is knife-thin on one side, allows it to fit in the gaps between closely spaced teeth. Use the thick side up on the top teeth, then thick side down on the bottom teeth. If you use them this way, they are quite comfortable - DAY 1! The pick alone will dislodge most food particles.The brush on the other end is molded onto a thin rod that fits into even tighter spaces that the pick side. The brush can then be manipulated as needed to get even the most stubborn food particles dislodged. I often spin the whole pick/brush to allow the brush side to do its thing.My father was a big toothpick guy, the wooden kind, but I could never get get them to work for me.

I researched alternatives to the floss and found these, also researched the proper way to brush teeth and started using the total care mouthwash. My gums stopped bleeding after about a month of using these and I would use the regular floss about twice a month just to get a little more thorough removal of junk in there. These could be a little more sturdy on the brush end of them as I have had a few bend and had to throw out but that's a few out of 250 which isn't bad.

I usually use Parissa mini eyebrow strips, which are great and easy to use (and are white and can be reused more than once), but I wanted to give something else a try and this seemed to be a good price for the amount that you get.There are a few things I didn't care for about these strips such as them being hard to see when you're peeling them off their backing. I also didn't care for the size and shape of the lower portion, which seemed way too big (at least for me) when you have to contend with eyelashes, lid and all of the rest.Lastly, once you use it, you're done - as in no retries. This is a bit frustrating, since the adhesiveness of the strips themselves isn't all that great. Though I'm experienced with using similar strips and waxing in general, I found myself having to go through several extras just to get the job moderately done. Mind, this is with a dry yet freshly-cleaned, oil-free face and appropriate hair length.Overall, I think this is good for beginners or for those who want a completely pain-free experience and don't mind giving it a few tries. I can say that it didn't hurt, there was no mess and the strips are pretty forgiving if you place things wrong. I found I liked the top portion more for its shaping purposes; however, I'm not sure this makes up for how many you have to go through or the shape and size of things alone - at least in my opinion.Shipment came quickly, too, I might add. :)","{0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0.95, 0, 0, 0, 0, -1.76823, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 4.65, 0, 2.85, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2.85, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, -2.442, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, -0.6, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0.15, 0, 0, 0, -2.442, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, -1.8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0.3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, -1.8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, -2.85, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, -3.441, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2.85, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0.45, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, -1.554, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2.664, 0, 0, 0, 1.665, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3.3, 2.85, 0, 0, 0, 0, -3.15, 0, 0, 0, 2.7, 0, 1.2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, -1.443, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, -1.5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3}",0.892,0.139,0.752,0.108,2,0,1497,283

I used them to cover up the large splint/bandage and my toes post-op and now I wear them over the hard cast.

It fits perfectly to the top of it (my cast ends a few inches below my knee). I am also using a Cast Cozy for extra warmth when I go outside or when my toes are really cold inside. Both are really needed IMO. Definitely get the XL for covering any cast or bulky bandage. That's what I have and it fits fine but I don't think a smaller size would work.

Don't get me wrong, it is definitely an expensive purchase. However, the money was well spent. My husband and I went through a considerable amount of trouble in regards to our children and trying to determine if they were truly having fevers. For a period of about 6 months, our kids were having fevers ranging from a low grade, to a true textbook definition of having a fever. Well, we were under the impression that they were. We have made several trips to the doctor's office, even switching pediatricians a few times in order to try to figure out what was going on. We were using an Exergen thermometer (which our doctor's office used)that continuously showed higher temperatures. Now, I'm not knocking the thermometer, in fact, it's helped us during other incidents of true fevers. But, based on what our pediatricians kept saying, the only way to get an accurate temperature reading is with a rectal temp. Now, the basic rectal thermometers that can be purchased at local pharmacies/walmart/target/etc never work for us.

He called WelchAllyn since we had no response from the Medical Supply Company. They asked if we purchased this thermometer in June? He said ummm no we just bought it 5 days ago. The associate said well this thermometer is registered as being purchased in June and we aren't sure if this Medical Supply company is a registered seller of these WelchAllyn thermometers. They are having a supervisor call us tomorrow. We called the Medical supply company yet again and finally had someone answer, unfortunately they seem like they could care less about the fact that it is not working and they definitely do not care that this could have been previously owned and returned. They told us there is a 15% restocking fee for returning it unless WelchAllyn says it was previously owned. WHAT!!! So they don't know if they are selling items that are previously owned and obviously faulty?

My husband and I have been trying to conceive for over 6 months and are trying everything to make it happen before he deploys. I have always had irregular periods- even my first one was. I had been on birth control mainly to regulate my periods before meeting my husband, and then afterwards to prevent pregnancy. I was having two periods a month or one every 45 days- just all over the map. Since coming off of birth control 7 months ago, my cycles would vary in length between 25 and 35 days. It was driving me crazy having to wonder for weeks at a time if I was just ""late"" again or if I was pregnant. Then when the cycles were shorter, my luetal phase was not long enough to carry out implantation, thsu preventing pregnancy. So I ordered Vitex. I have had a regular 27 day cycle for four months now. I can even pinpoint the exact day I will start my period which has NEVER happened. I will be taking this from now on instead of birth control (after a pregnancy- hopefully!) to regulate my cycles.

Dunn",4,"Clear skin, lighter menstrual cramps","I first started taking this because I saw it on Dr. OZ as a remedy for menstrual cramps, well what I saw on Dr. OZ was actually ""Chaste Tree Extract"" but I have not been able to find that. This is probably the same thing because it works. I started taking it a few days before I expected my period and continued until my period was over and my cramps were not as agonizing as they usually are. I soon started to notice that my hormonal acne (Nodulocystic acne on my chin) was not as bad when taking these supplements so I started taking it every day. That led to the unexpected ""problem"" of me not getting my period for several months. I got a little scared and went to the doctor about it. She told me to stop taking it and sure enough I got my period a few months later. I didn't take this stuff for a while because of the whole messing with my cycle thing, I figured it would be best not to do that, but recently my hormonal acne has been raging again, no amount of acne cream was making it go away so I started taking this again and it went away within a few days. I figure, maybe I can treat this stuff like the birth control pill (not for birth control obviously) but to even out my hormones and I can stop taking it for a week or so to make sure I don't go months without a period. At the time I was also taking St. Johns Wart which I am no longer taking, so that could have been the cause of my missed periods since it seems that everyone else reports more regular periods on this herb.","{0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0.55, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2.997, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2.775, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, -2.55, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, -2.4105, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, -1.8, 0, 0, 0, 1.95, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 4.8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, -3.6, 0, -1.8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2.55, 0, 0, 2.25, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, -1.8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2.34555, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, -1.8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, -1.8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0}",0.566,0.084,0.839,0.076,3,0,1494,297

I had read some reviews that said do not take Vitex if you have normal periods. I also get migraines. BAD migraines, usually the exact day before my period.Because of this economy, my husband moved out of state to look for work and so we have been seperated for the past 9 months. We timed out visits with eachother around ovulation. Still no luck. In May 2010, I started taking vitex. My first period happened as normal as usual but this time, no migraine! In July, I planned a visit up north to visit my husband. Upon returning to Florida, I discovered I was pregnant! This after 2 months of taking Vitex!SO, I am a believer in this! I'm sure there may have been other factors involved, the food is much fresher and healthier up north and we were just haning out having a good time, no stress. If nothing else, if you get hormone related migraines, I would try Vitex. I have had migraines for many years, so bad I have been in the hospital for them and I have a high pain threshold!

I used to have regular periods till I hit my late 20's, then my system started going crazy. I'd miss a period then get one the following month. Then I went for 3 months without...hence a trip to the dr and left with a prescription for Provera. I started researching Provera and only found bad stuff about it being synthetic... my search lead me to Vitex, and since its natural, I thought it's worth a try. I took one pill a day and the following month my period was right on schedule...and each month since!! I think it works wonderfully.Before writing this review, I read the others and noticed one lady writing about the decreased migraines. I used to suffer from migraines at least once a week, and they were bad & horrible. Bad enough to make a trip to the ER sometimes, as I was sure something much more was wrong...they were that intense! I noticed in the last past few months that I've had less migraines and they were less intense, some that I could skip taking a pill. Upon reading the other ladies reviews, I'm now confident it was Vitex regularing out the hormones that were causing the migraines. I too found that I'm less irritable and moody.I want to call Vitex the magic ""lady fix"".","{0, 0, 0, 0, 3.393, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, -1.4, 0, -0.6, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, -2.5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1.5, 0, 0, 0, 0.9, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, -2.5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, -2.5, 0, -2.5, -2.5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1.3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0.3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0.00700000000000001, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2.2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, -1.807, 0, 0, 0.3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0}",-0.89,0.071,0.829,0.101,0,4,1236,229

Driver",5,"Great for lowering high testosterone levels caused by PCOS","When I found this product for my daughter, she was 20 years old and just diagnosed with PCOS. She had moderate beard growth, very overweight, and extremely painful periods. After having a CAT scan done that diagnosed PCOS (they found cysts on her ovaries) and a blood test that showed an extremely high testosterone level (way above the normal range), I was quite alarmed when the doctor told us that he wanted to put her on Yaz birth control pills and spironolactone, a potassium-sparing diuretic (it acts as an anti-androgen, but then you have to monitor your potassium intake). I didn't want my daughter on these powerful drugs that both can have dangerous side effects (strokes for Yaz, cancer for spironolactone). So I decided to research a natural supplement that she could try first before resorting to the prescription medications. I found Vitex Chaste Berry Extract, and I started giving my daughter two capsules per day. There have been no side effects from taking this product. My daughter went back to the endocrinologist 6 months later for another blood test. I admitted to the doctor that my daughter had not taken the meds he had prescribed - that we had tried her on Vitex for the past 6 months. I promised him that if the blood test showed no improvement in her testosterone level, we would start her on the meds. Lo and behold, when the results of the blood test came back, my daughter's testosterone level was reduced to one-half of the previous level--and it is back in the middle of the normal range!! I was thrilled! This is a great product, and I highly recommend it for lowering testosterone levels in a female.","{0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0.8, 0, -0.8965, 0, 0, -1.0965, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, -0.8465, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, -0.333, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2.7, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, -3.15, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, -5.1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2.25, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2.1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, -1.8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0.6, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2.25, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, -2.22, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2.85, 0, 0, 0, 4.65, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2.6895, 0, 0, -1.5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0}",0.78,0.095,0.825,0.08,1,3,1635,288

My periods have always been irregular, however I still did not expect them to just stop when I was 25.. I suffered the mental agony of never getting periods unless I took Provera when I decided enough was enough. The wise Internet came to my rescue and convinced me that Vitex could be the solution. I started taking this product once a day (first thing in the morning) for 120 days (2 boxes) with a gap of 2 days when I forgot to pack it on a business trip. During those 120 days, I got 5 periods (spotting, very light to light flow). Then I decided to give myself a week's break... and got my full fledged period. So, so thankful!

It is great for removing lint and pet hair from clothing, furniture, bedspreads, etc., and I believe no dog or cat owner, or owner of any furry animal, should be without this item.It is also wonderful for removing fiberglass from your skin and clothing if you have been ripping out or installing fiberglass insulation or working with resin and fiberglass. If you've ever worked around fiberglass you know how it sticks in your skin and itches like mad. Evercare extra sticky lint roller actually pulls the fiberglass right out of your skin.Another great use for this product is removing seed ticks. If you live in the southern United States, you know what an unpleasant experience it is to wander into seed tick territory.

Thank goodness this was not the first one I ever got or I might not have tried again.What attracted me was that it is waterproof which has been an occasional lifesaver for shower time. I would normally not want the controls on the base though so I really don't want to even look at this option if I'm anywhere dry. I find it awkward to have to reach like that when adjustment is needed on intensity/speed. I also notice that the weight of the batteries at the base of the device requires more attention from me to keep the fun where it needs to be. In my other rabbits, having the control and battery pack as a separated portion allows me to easily and naturally deal with any sudden need to change the action in a comfortable position. It also makes the business end easier to handle, prop,maneuver, etc since it doesn't have all the extra baggage and weight at the base.The girth is a bit gluttonous for my tastes but it's not unmanageable. The beads inside look and sound a bit too scary and have not actually felt worthwhile to me. The ability to change direction has no appeal for me either but perhaps if someone is using the tip of the shaft for some foreplay this could be useful. I don't find it to be soft enough or set for a proper path to make that interesting with this device though. Other rabbits of more modest size have definitely delivered larger return though.The ears are too stiff and sometimes can hurt if not careful. ...and really, how careful can you remain when you are trying to let go and ""enjoy?"" For me, perhaps it's a YMMV thing, the ears also don't naturally land where they should when the other business aspect is where it needs to be. This requires some odd posturing and holding but it can be done to the desired end result. I have to emphasize that even when that result is achieved, my other rabbits give a higher quality reward and often in less time unless I purposely played it to last longer.Out of the package, the smell was really strong and surprised me since I had never noticed this in others I've gotten. It did not fade quickly in spite of repeated washing and even now it still smells ""industrial.""I would not buy this model again so hopefully I'll find a better waterproof rabbit option next time.","{0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1.7465, 0, 0, 0.75, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0.9, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1.4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, -0.111, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, -0.2139895, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, -0.3, 0, 0, 0, 0.05, 0.75, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1.15, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0.7, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1.15, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0.9, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, -3.3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, -1.554, 0, 0, 0, 1.95, 0, 0, 0, 0, -1.8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2.85, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2.55, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2.55, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, -3.6, 0, 0, -0.666, 0, 0, 0, 1.317525, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3.3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, -1.95, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1.65, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 4.05, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2.1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3.8895, 0, 1.74555, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, -3.6, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2.9895, 0, 0, 0, 2.85, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0}",0.99,0.14,0.805,0.055,3,0,2325,431

The size (at least for myself) was very intimidating and I'm still not sure if it's really the right ""fit"" for me.One big complaint on here is about the rubbery smell that emits from it. I didn't find this to be an issue at all. If you stick it right in your nose, yes, it stinks like rubber. I washed mine well before using and still noticed some smell but nothing that interfered in any way with my activity. Also complaints about this product not being soft of flexible are unfounded in my opinion. Even the ears are very soft and pliable. I found the ""rabbit"" part of this product especially enjoyable! The beads...I didn't really notice them to be honest but that also speaks to another complaint, I didn't notice any pain or ""scraping"" mentioned in some of the reviews. Other than that I have to say this is a VERY effective device! I mean...wow! The rubber is smooth and soft with some nice textures, the vibration is excellent and the controls are really simple. Also, it's very quiet! I have a small apartment and a roomie who knew I was expecting this in the mail. When it arrived she laughed as I headed straight for my bedroom to try it.

Upon taking it out of the box, it did have a toxic odor; this odor, however, had nearly disappeared after one use. I'm average height, but small and young (19 years old), so I was worried about the size, but it did not disappoint. It is a LITTLE big for me, but I didn't even use lube and I was fine - I just didn't plunge right in when using it. I could see the problem if you're used to something skinnier, but it's not so bad (~6"" circumference, ~1.6"" diameter). The rotation is my favorite part - it doesn't even stop moving like other rotating vibrators. The vibration is a little strong and the ears are not so pliable, but on the lowest setting in combination with the rotation, it is perfect. I definitely recommend this product, especially if you can get over size and are not sensitive to vibration.","{0, 0, 0, -0.4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, -0.4535, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, -0.45, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, -2.19555, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1.887, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1.2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, -2.55, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3.10023, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1.332, 0, 2.25, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3.0105, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, -2.4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 4.05, 0, 2.55, 2.25, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0}",0.973,0.172,0.756,0.072,5,0,909,166

The entire vibrator turned a yellow tint from where the beads are down to the base. It was one of our favorite toys for a while, until we discovered how cheaply built it was. The battery holder was the problem. It is cheaply made, so the thin contacts in the battery compartment which slides into the device are the most likely thing to break, which we soon discovered. What I learned from this was, you have to put your money where your mouth is when it comes to getting a quality sex toy. If you go cheap, you can go home. Forget this one. It is not a good investment and it will just break on you. In the short term, a couple of months, it will last, but don't expect it to work much longer than that.

Doesn't compare to other Jackrabbits!","I purchased this product expecting it to be fun but I am highly disappointed... Ive had jackrabbits in the past this one was nothing at all close to the quality of others Ive owned I really wish I never purchased this one now.. First there is the STRONG unpleasant odor that it has itself very chemically and gross! I washed it with 2 different soaps prior to use and it still made my hands and other parts smell like it! That killed me and my husbands kink for the night. Secondly the levels on the motors that make the metal beads run around arent all that different from first to 3rd its barely noticeable when change it. I basically tossed money down the drain because I cant get over the stink of the thing to use it again and I am pretty sure I wont be buying products from this company again out of fear the rest are like this! I've never had a product I was so disappointed in seriously and I've tried a lot. I certainly wouldnt recommend this product to friends or on the several forums I'm on that we talk about such things. Sure you cant return a product once its used but someone shouldnt sell a product that isnt good in the first place. I'm sure they all knew about the smell. I am sure there are testers they use... Well lesson learned I guess. I do hope this is helpful at least for further designs in the future so others dont have to have this experience.","{0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1.15, 0, 0, 0, 0, -3.5895, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2.9895, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 4.5495, -3.15, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, -3.54555, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2.25, 0, 0, -5.25, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, -2.55, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3.3, 1.95, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, -3.3, 0, 0, 0, 2.25, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, -3.5895, 0, -1.44555, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2.1, 0, -1.665, 0, 0, 0, 3.15, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1.95, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, -2.109, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1.95, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1.95, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1.65, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2.85, 0, 0, 2.7, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0}",0.887,0.16,0.719,0.122,2,3,1373,262

Waterproof is a fantastic feature. My husband enjoys using this on me, and it's not so complicated that I can't use it by myself. It is a little big, thick, so if you have a skinny guy, or skinny toys, this would take some getting used to, but it wasn't a problem for me, I like the size very much. The bunny ears are a little inflexible, but still work great. I wish it was a little longer, as far as insertable length, but as it is, it takes me only a minute or two before..... you know. Great toy if you need the extra girth, and it seems to have held up pretty well so far. It is also very quiet, which is a plus. Very discreet. I like the clear color, if it is lying out, your eye doesn't immediatly jump to the ""bright pink vibrator on the bed""!

It still rotates, but without the vibration it just feels like a big plastic-y thing spinning circles in there and actually hurt.

However, this is VERY quiet, I would say if you want to use it on the top speeds (although I haven't found the need to use it above the first) maybe have something like a desk fan to cover the sound if you want to keep it undetected. The twisting motion of the head can be a little more noticeable than the vibrating bullet, it's almost like a power drill on low, but it's muted. Again, anything above the first, you might wanna have some cover up.Also, something that wasn't covered in the description (if it was, I didn't see it): There's a panel with an increase button and decrease button for vibration and rotation of the head separately, so you can have all vibration, or a little of both, or just the rotation (there's also a button to switch the direction of the rotation) and at low, medium or high.I personally prefer more of an thrusting experience, so this probably won't be my favorite toy.

If you're afraid that it's too big, don't be. It's a great size that fits snugly and just feels so good. As with any toy, make sure that you're nice and wet first. If you have any trouble there, just read some of these reviews, lol, that did it for me. I always think my own natural juices are a better lube than the fake stuff that comes in a tube but whatever floats your boat.Start slowly and resist the urge to keep upping the intensity. I have to fight that urge every time because this thing gets me on the brink of ecstasy within a couple of minutes if I don't hold back a little. And I find that when I take my time, the orgasms (yes, that's plural) are just that much more intense.This literally makes me cum harder and faster than anything else I've ever used, including a real penis. Sorry honey, but your sexy cock just can't vibrate like this and it doesn't have a clit kisser either. Not that the rabbit will ever replace the real thing but if you've ever been frustrated with your orgasms - either the time it takes to get there or the ho-hum aspect of them - give this toy a try.The fun part of getting a new toy is finding just the right balance and spots for ultimate pleasure. I find that if I pull up on my labia just a little bit, it stretches my clit up just a fraction and produces even more friction and contact. I'm telling you, it is the most amazing feeling. Once I really get going and am super horny and ready to cum, I allow the ""cock"" to rotate in my pussy at the same time that the small buzzing ""lips"" are fluttering against my clit and then I begin thrusting it in and out of my pussy. The combination of the rotating inside, the clit-buzzing outside and the ever increasing thrusting in and out results in a mind blowing orgasm. You WILL cum with this toy.I can either take my time and end up begging to finally be sent over the edge or I can go for a quickie and literally cum hard and fast within a minute or two.Do not hesitate, buy this toy and get ready to have the best orgasms of your life.","{0, 0, 0, 1.35, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1.55, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1.0965, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0.65, 0, 0, 0.9, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, -0.85, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1.175, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0.75, 0, 0, 0, 0.95, 0, 0, 0, -1.05, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, -2.4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 4.35, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2.55, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, -0.45, 0, 0, 0, 3.6, -0.9, 0, 0, 0, -1.665, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2.55, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, -3.6, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3.45, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 4.05, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 4.6395, 1.167525, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 4.35, 0, 0, 2.25, 0, 0, 0, 1.35, 0, -0.9, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, -0.6, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1.221, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2.25, 0, 0, 0, 4.8, 0, 0, 0, 0}",0.995,0.158,0.796,0.046,3,0,2057,400

She really hated it. So i have relaxed on my purchasing of these types of toys. After a while we found one that really works. A small vibrator. Then last year I found a girth increase toy that fit on me. The wife really liked it and started to use it more and more. i figured if I stay away from weird looking vibrators she would like them. So last week after much looking and reading reviews I picked this up from Amazon. After alot of foreplay and much lube / bondage she opened up to it. I did blind fold her so she did not see it. She even told me after the fact that if she had seen it before she would have said no. It was pretty big but she liked it after the initial thrust. It was completely different then any thing else we have tried. which means it did different things to her body that was unique. I had to back it off a number of times to make it last. worked great to use while performing oral on her as well.ProsPower wise - GREAT. I would have liked to see 2 C batteries - there is enough room in it. The turning worked great at any speed. The vibration hit the sweet spot first time on. I kept the vibration at the minimal setting. Which was perfect for my lady. If you like more it has it.CONSI am not sure I would trust it in the water.

However my boyfriend likes to have oral sex and unfortunately fingers and tongue just doesn't keep me satisfied so I have to cut down on his time to get mine. I finally just told him that I would do that more for him if we got this for me. I ordered the clear rabbit because it was the cheapest of the colors and super saver shipping, I didn't see a reason to pay more for color it was function that was important to me. It was supposed to be here on the 10th of Jan and it was here on the 6th. I received it in a regular amazon box and it was in a white plastic bag inside. I opened it and it did have a smell (I washed it once and now it's gone) I think it was just a new toy smell. My boyfriend was in total control of it and we ended up using the ears anally which worked good and then after he was done I had him just use it on me to see what it could really do. OMG! I was done in under a minute. He tried all the different settings I think and it was heaven. But afterwards I just wanted a piece of him :) It was not much bigger than he is so size was not an issue. The rabbit hit me just right. I don't feel it was too hard and the rabbit ears were perfect for me. Like other reviewers have said, ""everyone's anatomy is different"" The vibration was awesome though I really don't need the highest setting yet and the rotation was perfect. I like that it can rotate clockwise or counterclockwise depending on how you want it to hit. All in all it was a perfect purchase and I plan on using it a lot more, can't wait to try out the waterproof feature. I bought this one because it had the most reviews and the best reviews.

Girth isn't a problem for me, although I was concerned about it after reading the reviews from others. It is not terribly larger than most of the men I've been with. The only reason I did not give this item 5 stars was what seems to be the #1 complaint about this item: the smell. It really is odd, however, this product is not meant to be stuck up your nose, so at least once it gets under the covers, it is not bad at all.The shipping time was amazing as well. I ordered it on Christmas Eve and actually had it before New Years. That was just the standard shipping.I like the fact that it is clear jelly, I am a tech and love to see the way things work, so seeing the innards in action is fun. I just wish the hard plastic was see thru as well, but I can see the visual reasoning for the silver. You can't see it in the photos, but under the head some of the raised bumps make a smili face.This by far outdoes any other product I have tried; it is fun, waterproof, clear, gets you off almost faster than you would like and has a smili face on it, definatly worth the money!AN UPDATE!I have now had this product for almost a year and am still happy with it; however I did discover a bit of a problem with its nature. I love this product so much I was using it at least once a day, and after a while my clitoris began to hurt. Long story short, it was the constant use of the product that caused it, as well as the insensitivity that folowed.

"B000N8X038","California Exotics Waterproof Jack Rabbit with Floating Beads","27.66","A35XIAZ0DNZ40G","JLF",2,"Look before you buy","I purchased this via Amazon. It was delivered in a regular Amazon box. Inside the box, the vibrator was in a white plastic bag and inside its retail packaging. It takes 3 AA batteries. It has a slight chemical smell. The total length to the base is about 7 inches; however, only about 5 inches is insertable due to the bunny on the side. It is very pliable and has raised bumps below the head on the opposite side of the bunny. It is approximately 5 inches in circumference. It has three levels of intensity and the head rotates. It does not thrust, it rotates around in a lopsided circle. There are 9 ball bearing in the shaft that go around in a circle. You can change the rotation from clockwise to counter-clockwise. Why change the direction of the rotation? I do not know.The bunny is approximately 4 1/2 inches in length at its longest point, which is the base of the machine to its ears. On the short side, the bunny is about 2 1/2 inches in length. The bunny ears are pliable and separate, and the bunny has a pointy nose. There is a bullet inside the bunny. The bunny also has three levels of intensity.I like the rotation of the shaft and the thickness. The intensity in not bad, not earth shattering, but not bad. Here's the down side. I just don't get the bunny. If the ears are supposed to be the stimulation, the distance between the end of the ears and the end of the shaft are 2 3/4 inches. If I am supposed to use the bunny's ears to tickle my clitoris, then I can only insert 2 3/4 inches of the shaft. If the nose is supposed to be the stimulation, then I can only insert 3 1/2 inches of the shaft to feel the bunny's nose. If the bullet is the stimulation, then I have about 2 inches of bunny ears & nose keeping my clitoris away from the bullet. Because the bunny is attached to the shaft at five inches, there is no way that I can insert more than that, but when I do insert 5 inches, the bunny is way above my clitoris and uncomfortable. I read one comment that stated that she cut the ears of the bunny off. That may help, but not I'm not trying that...yet.The next concern is the rotation. You have to have a firm grip on the device for the rotation to work. It you insert the vibrator and hold it at the base, the head rotates. However, if you do not hold the vibrator tightly, the base rotates while the head stays fixed. Again, weird workings.I suggest that you look at this in a retail store. When you see it in person, you will understand what I mean about the bunny's ears & nose being too high up the shaft. If you love the bunny and only want 2 3/4 to 3 1/2 inches of shaft, this may be the toy for you. Unfortunately, I am still looking for Mr. Right Vibrator.","{0, 0, 0, 0, 0.35, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0.35, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0.75, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0.925, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2.775, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, -1.8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, -2.4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, -1.65, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2.55, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, -1.05, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 4.8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0.45, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, -2.1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0}",0.714,0.039,0.936,0.026,3,0,2694,527

If you can accomodate a human, you can take this no problem. I took a measuring tape and wrapped it around the thickest part, it's only 5 inches around. Use lube though.B) It doesn't smell any more or less plastic-y than any other vibrator.C) Mine is quite pliable. While it doesn't bend, I didn't expect it to, but it is soft. But not too soft!! ;)I bought this because I wanted a thicker vibrator. And while I like a lot, I only gave it 4 stars for 2 reasons. First, the rabbit IS too high up the shaft. The ears hit about a quarter inch higher than they should, so the shaft can't go in all the way if you want them where they're supposed to go. Second, the insertable part is actually shorter than it looks, due to the placement of the rabbit. The beads are closer to the surface that my old one, so I definitely feel them.

It is girthy so it takes some getting used to, but the rotation is very powerful and the vibrations are also great. The down side is that sometimes the clit stimulator can be painful as it is not very soft and flexible. The lowest speed is also quite intense so sometimes takes a few minutes before I can apply it directly. I use this on a very regular basis as my husband is deployed. He and I have played with it on multiple occasions as well. The handle is long enough for him to hold which is awesome. Obviously it has gotten alot of use and still looks new and shows no signs of breaking. The battery life is very good. It is quiet and powerful. The only downside is that is never really ""breaks in"" Very stiff and can at times be painful.

Jones ""JuiciJ""",4,"Play like Bunnies","The Waterproof Jack Rabbit Vibrator is a dual action vibrator. One motor for clitoral stimulation and one motor for vaginal stimulation. The classic ""rabbit"" design. I haven't tested its claim of being waterproof by taking it in the hot-tub, but don't worry I will!The penis shaped design is supposed to make penetration and thrusting easier, however it is bigger than most vibrators so be prepared with lubrication. The nice thing about this vibrator is that it is made with jelly so you can use water or silicone based lubrication. The jelly also makes it flexible. I found this to be a downside in that it didn't hit my g-spot as well as other dual action vibrators. A plus side is the vibrator's rotating tip that gyrates in circles to tease your vagina and the massaging beads that allow the vibrator head to roll and rub against your G-spot for stimulation.The ""rabbit ears"" tickle and tease your clit if you can get them positioned correctly. I found the push button control pad to be bulky and hard to use in the ""heat of the moment"". You get to select from 3 different Rotation and Vibration Speeds or push a button to reverse the spin completely.It uses 3 AA batteries, which is goes through quite quickly. Have plenty on hand. It comes in clear, pink or purple.Once you get past the bulkiness and large size and figure out how to use the control pad of the Jack Rabbit it can produce some great orgasms.

That's really all I can say about this one. Opening the box.... I was quite surprised to see just how big this one was. Because of it's girth, I wouldn't recommend it to someone who is inexperienced with these sorts of toys and/or not sexually active. Insertable length is just over 5 inches and girth is about 5.5 inches around.I was surprised to hear just how quiet this vibrator is. It's far more quiet than other rabbits I have owned. And for being so quiet, it really has a lot of power! You might want some cover-up noise if you're using the second or third power levels though. (A fan, TV or covering the vibrator with a pillow all work well for this.) :)As other reviewers have stated... the smell of this vibrator is rather overpowering when you first take it out of the package. However, the first couple of washes seemed to cut it quite a bit, so I believe the smell will mostly wear off after 5-6 washes.Takes 3AA batteries, very easy to put them in.

I found this exact model at Ambiance for twice the price, so you're getting a really good value buying it here. All I can say about the delivery is that I paid extra to have it over-nighted and it came two days later (oh well, it wasn't an emergency..). I've only had it a few days but it has worked every time, so I feel good about the money I spent on it, however I will probably buy another one eventually with a few different things in mind. I don't really care for the rotating beads- I used them the first couple of times and then just started turning them off because they were distracting and didn't really add any pleasure. I feel like I couldn't get it deep enough or the ears would overshoot my clit.

I'd say just about right.The bad....I cannot use the metal balls/rotation part of this toy which is the main reason I bought it. While the size is great (it matches my partners size perfect)adding in something that rotates, moves, and is made out of metal...for me it was to much, and not in a the good kind of way.

This was my first experience with a rabbit-style vibrator, but it more than lived up to the hype. The vibrating bullet boasts some serious power and several settings to build up to.

The length is perfect for me and the controls are surprisingly easy to access. There are a few downsides, but nothing that can not be remedied. The product does have that distinct skunky plastic smell, although after a few washes it fades a way. Plus, this product isn't really designed to be used by your nostrils.

It bears all of your back weight and it's spinning is converted into the roller motion. That might sound fancy, but when you look at it, it is a small plastic part.When I contacted support, they would not sell me the bearing or even to upper support assembly. The only option was to buy the whole massage mechanism, motor and all for $130.I was frustrated, but I loved the massage, so I purchased and installed the mechanism.It is a self contained unit, so unplug a few connectors, bolt it down... an easy replacement.18 months later it broke again and I threw it away.I am a 170lb man who used it maybe twice a week for 30 minutes.In my second deconstruction, I noted it again broke in the upper support area.

Scanlan",5,"Got desired results","I have been taking prescribed statins for years and developed muscle pains in my legs that many neurologists cannot diagnose. Finally, an alternative medicine doctor said it could be &#34;statin-induced neuropathy&#34;, so I stopped taking the prescribed statins.My cholesterol levels went up without the medications. I searched for alternatives to lower my cholesterol and came across the book &#34;Statin Drugs and their Natural Alternatives&#34; by Jay Cohen, M.D. One of the things mentioned was Cholestin(Red Yeast Rice). The first red yeast rice I tried was Choleast by Thorne Research and after 3 months decreased my cholesterol some but not to acceptable levels. Then, I switched to Cholestene by High Performance Formulas. To my and my Doctor's surprise after only 2 months of taking 2 capsules daily, my total cholesterol and LDL cholesterol levels are down to acceptable levels. Even my Doctor asked what I've been taking. Part of the message I wish to convey is that NOT all Red Yeast Rice formulas have the same effectiveness...so be aware of this.","{0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, -0.9, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, -0.589175, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, -0.6, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0.75, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, -1.443, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1.65, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1.95, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2.55, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0}",0.656,0.06,0.898,0.042,1,0,1061,177

Not here!","I like the Green Tea Diet pill for many reasons. First, it causes the bored eater (that'd be me) from eating aimlessly throughout the day. Secondly, since I've taken it for the 2 and half months that I have (actually this started happening within a few weeks and has continued), the capsules have helped shrink my stomach to probably half of what it used to be, so that when I do eat, I don't overdo it. Keep in mind that when I say stomach, I mean the one your food drops into, not your waistline. However, by no means am I saying that there's no weightless physically. There is!So far I've lost 15 pounds. Some of you might be thinking, ""Well that's surely with exercise, and I'm not one to have time to do that, or I hate exercising."" You know what? For those of you that DO exercise you'll lose even more weight than me at the 2.5 month mark, because I go about day to day doing general stuff, nothing like walking or jogging for miles or riding a bike. However, I've figured a few things are key to those that aren't too keen on exercise (the word alone makes me shudder).If you don't have time to exercise routinely or for very long, or you just hate the word ""exercise"" (I know it can cause terror within a few of us, don't lie) then keep these things in mind when you take this amazing pill:-Going to the grocery store? Don't go when you're hungry and don't park in the closest to the building spot (unless it's dark then it can be scary). For obvious reasons, don't go when you're hungry, you'll just end up popping everything into your cart (some stuff you don't even know what the heck it is when you get home to unpack). Instead, and I'm sure you know this, maybe go after dinner or after lunch. What to get? That's another few paragraphs down.-Going shopping? Does that word make you giddy with delight?...only until you realize you really don't have the money to be doing it? Alright, here's the solution. Go to the mall or outlet stores or wherever else it is you could spend hours looking around at stuff. Park in the furthest from the building spot, leave the tempting ways of payment either at home or in your car (hidden with stealth!), go in the building and window shop! Spend at least a half hour doing this to however long (though you'll get kicked out if you try to stay past closing time). If you think it's weird to exercise in the mall/store, it's really not. I know I've seen a few power walkers in my mall and it's totally obvious what they're doing, but the thing is you DON'T have to do that. Exercising this way is as easy as just browsing stores, circulating the mall, bypassing the food court (unless you need water) and checking out potential Christmas gifts while getting a regular workout!-Play with your kids for at least a half hour a day (outside)! Play hide and seek! Run after them! Shoot hoops (not only is it exercise, it's helping hand-eye coordination!), throw a few balls, kick a soccer ball, play on the swing set, walk around the park while your kids play! There's so many great activities and family bonding time you can do and get an easy workout, too! It's a win-win for both you and your kids.-No kids? Pets are the next best thing. I have three dogs and one cat. They're the sweetest, most evil things in the entire world! Not only do they make me take a run for my money (literally, cause they steal my shoes and anything else they can get and take outside) they also warm my heart and make me laugh and smile. 30 minutes playing with your pets is a another great way to help amplify the effects of this diet pill!-Have a good laugh. Find your funny friends, people, and laugh as much as you can! You lose loads of calories that way!There's definitely more small things that can help you lose weight, especially when taking this pill, but what about what food is right?Stay away from carbs. Period. They are not your friend all the time. Especially since they let lose all the things your fatty cells need to keep their greedy little lives prosperous in your thighs/stomach etc. Must have them? I know your pain. Instead start getting used to whole grain and wheat. Don't shrink in terror, it's not that bad!

I started really watching what I eat and stepped up my exercise big time in January, and I had been losing weight healthily and consistently (i.e. 2-3 pounds a week). But once I lost about 15 pounds on my own, I hit a major plateau...I mean my weight WOULD NOT MOVE. I started taking these, and I literally busted through my plateau. I only take one in the morn and one in the afternoon with my multivitamin. I also make sure I have something on my stomach before I take these, just to make sure I don't get an achy tummy. On the downside, like a couple other customers, I had a couple of days where I got some big-time headaches. But outside of that, it's great. I have also noticed that my appetite has decreased slightly and I also don't have big cravings for the ""good stuff"" (i.e. Haagan Daaz ice cream, caramel cookies, etc.) like I used to. I have also noticed that my energy is just about through the roof...I'm even exercising at work by power walking for 30 mins. I NEVER even thought about doing that before these pills. I'm a tea drinker with an occasional cup of coffee, and this gave me less jitters but more energy (if you can think of that). No shaking hands, toe tapping...just raw energy. I don't get sleepy at work like I used to either. I'm on my last few days of pills, so I think I'm gonna take a break for a month and start back up with the Triple Tea ones instead. But I have to say...like any other weight loss program, to get the best results, you gotta watch what you eat and you gotta move...there's no way around it...at least for me.

I purchased this walker because I loved the fact that there was no assembly and it had a ""cool"" look to it. It definitely looked different from most.This thing is the SUV of walkers. It's not feather light but it certainly is sturdy. There is no assembly required and you simply pull it out of it's large box and go. One push of a lever and the rollator collapses (folds) vertically so that it can fit easily in a trunk or back seat. The wheels are large and smooth and this thing actually handles curbs and grass and changes of terrain easily. It's rough and tough and looks like it can take a beating and handle abuse pretty well.The seating is very comfortable and this rollator adjusts easily (arm height) with simple lever pushes. There are no brake cables or anything to assemble. It's ready to go out of the box and that is one of the reasons I chose it. I also bought this one because it looked a little different (resembles a baby carriage more than a traditional rollator or walker).It drives smoothly, is easy to operate and is extremely comfortable. What more could I ask for?I bought the blue version since I saved about $100 on Amazon compared to the other colors. The blue and silver is very nice.

Nikle ""tokkan""",5,"Versatility Plus","My husband suffered a heart attack a few years ago becoming unstable on his feet. His first walker/rollator had 8"" wheels and was handy and lightweight, good, but not the best in Alaska's winter snows. Also the seat was not adjustable for height and it wasn't exactly the right height for my husband. We purchased the Cosco rollator because of it's sturdiness and even larger wheels and it is the most versatile item we own. As it is designed for use, the wheels are wonderful for crossing all kinds of terrain, level, snowy, or gravel. The seat adjustment is easy, quick, and comfortable. The Handles also adjust easily without having to take any screws out and move parts, as we had to do on his first rollator. It folds easily and transports in the back of our pickup without a problem. It is 'slightly' heavy compared to other lighter weight walker / rollators, but it's versatility outweighs the 'slightly heavy' aspect. For those who are more active its great for hauling things. I am able to stack several pieces of firewood on the seat saving my back and arm muscles from fatigue. It enables my husband to do this chore too which he would not be able to do otherwise. When company comes I use it as my 'spare chair', handy and comfortable for me. I also use it as a foot rest since the lazyboy is always occupied.This is the second Cosco Rollator I purchased because of frequent loaning the first one out to others as needed. Now we don't have to be without a Cosco. Bottom line - I just love this rollator and would keep it around even if it wasn't needed for walking purposes.I was able to purchase by new blue Cosco rollator from Amazon, on sale for $107.-00 - a terrific price!","{0, 0, -1.1, 0, 0, -1.05, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, -0.75, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0.95, 0, 0, 0, -3.552, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 4.05, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, -0.75, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2.85, 0, 0, 3.45, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2.1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, -1.5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2.1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1.887, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2.9895, 0, 5.04555, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, -1.5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3.45, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 4.8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1.05, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3.15, 0}",0.991,0.144,0.808,0.048,2,1,1689,306

It was impossible to get through to the company on its 800# After 32 mins. of elevator music, I gave up, and had someone else repair the wheels. The removable basket sits on the lip of the frame which causes frequent falling off, and it holds only 10lbs. The walker weighs approx. 18lbs and does not fold as compactly as the traditional walkers. The back wheels have a lever that brings the wheels in to meet up with the front wheels to fold, this is done while standing which takes up a wide portion of a car seat, and you have to allow for the height. All of the above has decreased the Cosco Traveler Rollator by 5 points.Now the 4.5 star points of the Cosco Traveler Rollator:It is not your traditional walker. It comes in great colors: grey, blue or geranium. It is easy to lift the seat up to different heights. The handles are easily adjustable. The brakes work very well. It holds up to 275lbs, and is very easy to propell. It's easy to use indoors or out. It fits easily inside doorways, and easy to use in department stores of little space. It gives the disabled a great looking easy to use vehicle of ambulatory assistance. It's a modern and useful product. It gets 4.5stars for the ease of use......Once the wheels are working properly. I love it!Nov. 06, 2007My walker began to lose nuts, bolts and pieces, and began to pull to the right. The wheels began to flap from side to side rather than roll. Target was notified and got me in touch with The DJG group (supplier). After signing a release of responsibility form, I was told that I would receive a replacement rollater. On Nov. 21st a 2nd call to DJG who advised they would call back. Nov. 22nd a third call was made to DJG and I was told that I'd receive another within 5-7 days. It is quite a hassel dealing with the supplier, but I am hoping that the rollater was just a defective model. I give the supplier only 2 stars.

Its strength is low enough that I can hold it to skin for a longer period of time than some other infrared devices, giving the heat time to do its job and provide comfort. Bonus: it increases blood flow to the skin, smoothing and healing irritated areas. Because of its low wattage I don't have to worry much about being overzealous and causing damage. Only complaint: the threaded plastic where the red cap screws onto the base is thin, a little too much pressure when screwing it back on and the plastic will crack.","{0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2.093, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 1.5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2.2, 0, -1.1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1.4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1.5, 2.5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, -2, 0, 0, 0, 0, -1.1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1.406, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, -2.2, 0, -1.2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, -1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, -0.9363, 0, -0.9, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0}",0.732,0.151,0.726,0.123,0,0,706,126

I had been researching hoodia for a little while, and decided that I would try this product since it was inexpensive and had free shipping. I have lost weight using this, combined with exercise and a large cutback in caloric intake, but have some issues with this product. Since I have researched more, I have found that hoodia is very expensive, so it seems unlikely that this company would strengthen the concentration of hoodia 20:1 and sell it for ten dollars a box. Most other reputable hoodia brands cost around $50 for a nondiluted 100% hoodia stock, so I have doubts about whether this product contains any hoodia at all. However, this does contain A LOT of caffeine. I typically only drink 1 cup of tea during the day, and found that taking these pills do make me jittery and keep me up at night. Even sleeping pills have not helped me to fall asleep. The box also suggests that if you would like to increase the amount of weight lost, you can take double the amount instructed. I have also tried this, and found that I act as though I am totally high. I am off the wall, feel disconnected, and cannot come down for many hours. This combination of single and double doses (I have stopped taking the double) have caused me to lose sleep almost the entire time that I have been taking it. The box instructs you not to take these pills in the evening if you cannot sleep after taking caffeine, but I can drink coffee right before bed and not have an issue. These pills are a different story. The lastest that I have been taking these pills is 1pm and still not been able to sleep at 10. I know that this is long, but I wanted other people who may be interested in trying this, to know about my experiences before they spend their money. Since ordering this pack of three, I have done a lot more investigating and have actually purchased a different brand of 100% south african hoodia that comes with all of the required paperwork for the legit pills. By the way, this product does not include the required c.i.t.e.s. and other documentation stating that it actually comes from south africa, or that it has been tested by an independent lab confirming its contents.In conclusion, I have lost weight with this product, but I think that it may be due to the amount of stimulants, and not the hoodia that I don't believe is included.","{0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3.45, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3.45, 0, 0, 0, -1.95, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1.95, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, -2.19555, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2.25, 0, 1.95, 0, 0, 0, 0, -1.95, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, -1.35, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, -2.55, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2.55, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, -1.95, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0}",0.686,0.046,0.916,0.038,5,0,2425,445

We both go to the Chiropractor and have the Mediflow Waterbased pillows (see my review for those and the pillow case) but the addition of these 2 items was a great investment. We both suffer from neck and back pain and arthritis so we have tried many different things to help ease our pain and discomfort.My husband has used the NeckEase several times already and I used it the other night...heated it in the micro, wrapped it around my neck and climbed into bed for the night. Was very comfortable laying there with my head on my Mediflow Waterbased pillow and before I knew it I was fast asleep!I've used the Sinus Pillow twice now. We live in West TN and this time of year we can have some crazy weather - in the 70s one day and down to the 40s the next. This weather wreaks havoc on my sinuses, causing me lots of sinus pain and pressure and some pretty strong and painful, pounding headaches. I just heat my Sinus Pillow in the micro for the recommended time, lay down and place it over my eyes and nose and once again, it's not long until I'm fast asleep. Now, I'm not going to say it took my headache away completely each time, but it sure does relieve the sinus pressure and greatly reduces the pounding pain in my head so that I can relax and fall asleep quite easily. The various scents given off from each pillow is wonderful and very soothing.I would recommend both of these products and look forward to using them for years.

The investment in your health and comfort level is well worth the price. The polar fleece cover makes this warm and cozy, while the black cloth on the other side makes this pack radiate cold better when the pack is put in the freezer. So, you can use this in the winter or summer or anytime heat/cold is needed.To heat, put in the microwave for 2 to 3 minutes. To cool, keep in freezer until needed. You may want to put this in a plastic bag first if storing in the freezer.Over the years, the aromatic spices and herbs seem to retain their scent and the rice never seems to dry out, which is quite amazing.Ingredients: Rice, cinnamon, cloves, allspice and black pepper.This truly will relax tense shoulders when heated in the microwave.

It dictates whether or not your skin will produce more sebum, which, in turn, dictates whether the oil produced will be enough to moisturize or clog your skin.This product, one of my many moisturizers, is very good to not leave your skin dry or clog it up. It is a very light moisturizer, easily absorbed into the skin. The pleasant orange scent is very refreshing as well.The only downsides to the product, in my opinion, are the lack of product and the high price. Don't let the decent size of the container fool you. It is a mere 1.7 ounces, which is enough for a few weeks if you are conservative about it. It retails for about 35 dollars, which is not cheap.Granted, it is a great product, but at that price range you can really get a wider variety of higher end products. Billy Jealousy, Anthony, Lucky Tiger, all of those are just a few other brands with great moisturizers for a much better price.Conclusion: If you have the money, you will love this product regularly. For the rest of us, it is worth trying at least once in your life. You could even ask for a sample from Nordstrom to see if you think you will like it.","{0, 0, 0, 0, 0.5465, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1.0965, 0, 0, 0.074, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0.83185, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1.15, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, -0.65, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, -0.95, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1.55, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, -1.95, 0, 2.7, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 4.65, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2.85, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 4.8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1.35, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2.25, 0}",0.982,0.143,0.831,0.026,1,0,1207,223

They just don't taste good at all to me. There is something ""off"" about the taste. The chocolate doesn't really taste much like chocolate at all -- I'm not sure how to describe it. In addition, there is an aftertaste that other people have mentioned they noticed in Zoe bars. Even taking into account that they are designed to be lower in refined sugar and higher in fiber, they are still quite bland and could use more sweetness. In no way do they taste even close to a candy bar like other protein bars can. I am a major connoisseur of the lower-sugar, lower-calorie, higer-fiber protein bars, and I have to say that Zoe's bars rank last in my opinion. I have had many other bars with the same approximate amount of sugar and number of calories that were all sweeter, more filling, more satisfying, and simply taste way better all around. Three of my favorites that I would recommend: Kashi's Go Lean Rolls, Detour's U-Turn bars, and Balance 100 calorie bars.Of note: I have also tried Zoe's Peanut Butter and Zoe's Chocolate/Peanut Butter bars, and they are slightly better than these, thankfully.

We both go to the Chiropractor and have the Mediflow Waterbased pillows (see my review for those and the pillow case) but the addition of these 2 items was a great investment. We both suffer from neck and back pain and arthritis so we have tried many different things to help ease our pain and discomfort.My husband has used the NeckEase several times already and I used it the other night...heated it in the micro, wrapped it around my neck and climbed into bed for the night. Was very comfortable laying there with my head on my Mediflow Waterbased pillow and before I knew it I was fast asleep!I've used the Sinus Pillow twice now. We live in West TN and this time of year we can have some crazy weather - in the 70s one day and down to the 40s the next. This weather wreaks havoc on my sinuses, causing me lots of sinus pain and pressure and some pretty strong and painful, pounding headaches. I just heat my Sinus Pillow in the micro for the recommended time, lay down and place it over my eyes and nose and once again, it's not long until I'm fast asleep. Now, I'm not going to say it took my headache away completely each time, but it sure does relieve the sinus pressure and greatly reduces the pounding pain in my head so that I can relax and fall asleep quite easily. The various scents given off from each pillow is wonderful and very soothing.I would recommend both of these products and look forward to using them for years.

So, you can use this in the winter or summer or anytime heat/cold is needed.To heat, put in the microwave for 2 to 3 minutes. To cool, keep in freezer until needed. You may want to put this in a plastic bag first if storing in the freezer.Over the years, the aromatic spices and herbs seem to retain their scent and the rice never seems to dry out, which is quite amazing.Ingredients: Rice, cinnamon, cloves, allspice and black pepper.This truly will relax tense shoulders when heated in the microwave. Can also be used on lower back if you are laying in bed on your side because of the shape of the product.~The Rebecca Review","{0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1.5, 0, 0, 1.1, 0.9, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0.9, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1.9, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1.3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0.3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1.9, 0, 1.9, -1.4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, -1.2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0}",0.92,0.112,0.863,0.025,0,0,949,175

Their ability to add a whole new dimension to the ambience and conversation of a given party never fails to impress either the host or the guests. My only issue with the Litecubes is that once their batteries run out (about 8 to 12 hours depending on storage and usage conditions), you have no choice but to dispose of them and purchase replacements (which can get rather expensive if you own several sets of them in different colors like I do) since it is not possible to reseal the watertight plastic casing that houses the batteries. It would have been nice if they had designed them so that the batteries could recharged by placing the litecubes on a charger base of some kind, which would solve the power capacity issue for the most part without having to physically remove the batteries.

Scarzone works to an extent. If you really want to see results you must be very consistent and apply twice each day, rubbing the cream into the scar for about 2 minutes. That aside, I have been using this product for three weeks now and I see a difference. Not a huge difference, but very minimal. My opinion is this product would only work for newer scars that leave discolored marks on the skin. I highly doubt this product would work for old deeper scars (which is what I have) or anyone that suffered from longer-term acne scarring. This product also works by evening skin tone and reducing redness. All in all, it would work for anyone who has light scarring but don't expect a huge difference.

Duguay",5,"Positive Changes, Blueberry Tastes Much Better Than Banana","I believe this product received a very unfair review strictly based on taste. I just received this bottle this week and I have to say, the Blueberry is much better than the banana! It's also important to keep this in the fridge after you open it.My naturopath doctor has me on this and about 3 other probiotic/flora supplements along with colostrum to treat both acid reflux and IBS. I'm grateful to have found this on Amazon because his markup is at least 50%. The important thing about taking a probiotic in liquid form is that sometimes it is important to have the beneficial bacteria colonize in the stomach and even esophagus. Capsules are meant to become available further down the GI tract to make your colon happy. I'm finding that with the use of a good digestive enzyme and this liquid probiotic, I've been able to go off my proton pump inhibitor (PPI's like Prilosec and Nexium) which has given me stomach polyps from prolonged use.The theory is that regular use of anti-biotics, the stomach and intestines can become out of balance and unable to function naturally due to a lack of good bacteria.It's important to take aloe vera juice regularly(3x/day in between meals) to heal the esophagus and stomach. That in conjunction with a product like this can get you on the path to healing. I no longer have chest pain and I can also digest dairy. Amazing!A final thing about this. Some probiotics are designed so that you rely on them. The bacteria in them will not live longer than a day. I believe that this product is designed to actually grow and colonize to the point where you will not need it again after 3-4 months of use. The only time you would need it again is after taking an anti-biotic.Good luck and keep an open mind.","{0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, -2.393, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1.9, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0.8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1.7, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0.7, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0.8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0.8, 0, 0, 0, 1.9, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2.7, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1.9, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, -0.3, 0, 1.5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, -1.3, 0, 1.9, 0, 0.8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1.5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, -1.2, 0, 0, 0, -2.3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0}",0.972,0.113,0.85,0.037,0,2,1740,317

I did not expect much to about $8, but I did not think I would get such Cr*P. most of the screws had NO SLOT on the end. this means that there is no way to tighten them. they had inserted a note in the kit""screws w/out slots fit into round end of screwdriver and tighten with friction"".NO! NO! NO! it just does not work. first of all, there is NO round end of the screwdriver. 2nd, even if there was, there is just NO WAY you could hope to hold down a completely smooth and rounded end of a very little screw, so it could be tightened. to be fair, some of the screws did have slots, but the longer ones DID NOT. the long ones were the only ones that I needed, so this purchase was a complete waste of time & $. I would never order anything else from this store. if they would sell this, then you can not trust them. they obviously got an order of screws that were defective & are trying to get rid of them. just think about it.

As far as this kits variety trust me when I tell you that no matter what kind of hardware combo you have, there is a replacement one in this set. Most of the screws are slotted, but others have a solid head that utilizes a pressure system for those repairs that are either hard to fit, or where the screw slots have just been worn over time. I really don't know how well they work for I have not as of yet had any need for them. But I know that they will be a good last resort repair if all else fails, and also know that the slotted screws can easily be stripped at times no matter how careful we are. Also, for what it's worth I did not have the problem with all the little pieces being strewn about upon arrival like so many other reviewers here have complained about. Perhaps by this date they have read enough of the reviews themselves and learned to just seal the case for shipping like mine was. Or maybe I just got lucky. In any event, all parts arrived intact and where they were supposed to be.In conclusion, these kits are pretty scarce in stores, and usually one has little choice in the matter as to the brand and size, etc. Even on Amazon there is not a large selection of them to write home about. Trust me when I tell you this is the most complete, and as good as it gets for repairs without dropping your glasses off at a shop. Great set, good price, and highly recommended...","{0, 0, 0, 0, 1.0465, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0.95, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0.35, 0, 0.85, 1.25, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, -0.2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0.9, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, -0.5035, 0, 0.41815, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, -0.5, 0, 0.7, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0.15, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0.75, 0, 0, 0, 0, -0.5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1.35, 0.75, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1.15, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, -0.037, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, -0.63185, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0.9, 0, 0, 0, 0, -1.8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, -0.6, 0, 2.25, 0, 0, 0, -0.6, 0, 0, 0, 0, -1.8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, -1.221, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2.85, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, -2.7, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, -1.5, 0, 2.1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, -0.111, 0, 0.9, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1.35, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1.887, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2.25, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, -2.55, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2.25, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2.7, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1.2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3.3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0.15, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1.05, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3.45, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2.85, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 4.65, 0, 2.85, 0, 0, 0, 1.6395}",0.994,0.167,0.772,0.061,2,0,2227,432

Good assortment of screws.","I recently uncovered my 5-6 year old pair of Oakley 'Why 8' wire-framed sunglasses that I had not seen since I lost a screw holding the earpiece to the lens. I bought another pair of glasses and sent these to the scrap pile thinking that would be the last that I would see of them. I misplaced my newer glasses one day and did not have a backup, only finding my broken pair. I took my old pair of glasses to the Oakley store and they were no help. They told me they could not fix it in store and would have to send it away...sounds like a way to make some more money to me. The guy at the store did advise me that I could probably go to a regular eyeglass store and get them fixed. When he told me this, I realized I should have just fixed them myself from the beginning and looked to Amazon for an eyeglass repair kit with an assortment of screws. I was able to narrow down a few candidates for a replacement screw and simply replaced the missing screw and fixed my $200+ pair of sunglasses. The head of the screw I chose is a bit smaller than the original, but as far as I am concerned it makes no difference.One minor issue: Although I feel like I already got my moneys worth out of this kit and am very happy with it all of the screws arrived mixed up in the container in contrast to the picture depicting well organized screws. It would also help if the screwdriver came magnetized.","{0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, -0.65, 0, -0.2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, -1.05, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, -0.629, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0.75, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0.35, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, -0.5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, -0.2, 0, 0, 0, 0, -0.6, -0.2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, -0.2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0.65, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, -1.8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2.25, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1.35, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 4.4895, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, -1.5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1.65, 0, -1.5, 0, 0, 0, 2.55, 0, 0, 0.45, 0, 0}",0.816,0.08,0.848,0.072,1,0,1387,273

Oommen ""Abhi""",4,"No bells or whistles, nothing fancy but does the job quite allright!","My 1.5 year old son's favourite toy is eye-wear prespcription glasses and sunglasses (both mine and my wife's)and as a result, we had a lot of lost nose pads and loose legs on our glasses. Also recently bought some Banana Plugs for my home theatre system speakers from Lowe's and to my surprise they were the ones with the tiny screws in them, not the screw on type that I had bought from Amazon earlier,24k Gold Connector Banana Plugs, Open Screw Type 24 Pack (12 Red, 12 Black). I did not have a screwdriver that would fit the small screws on those, so I needed a small screw driver (was using a pen knife earlier to tighten and loose those screwes and it is pretty much a very frustrating job).So I started my search on amazon for a small screw driver and then thought about why not buy a glass repair kit and kill two birds with one stone, and stumbled upon this kit. Also read reviews and checked many other kits, while reviewing this and decided on this one maninly because of the price and it looked like it had a lot of pieces in it. Got it last week and overall I'm extremely happy with the kit, except for the fact that it is the worst packaging I have ever seen for small products like these. Everything was everywhere when i got the case and couldn't figure out which one went where and the fact that these pieces all require a magnifying glass to see them better wasn't helpful.But anyways apart from that it was a great buy and did the job wonderfully, both with our glasses and the banana jacks, the nose pads fit very well and i could find screws the right size for our glasses and the banana jacks (I had lost one of them on the carpet earlier when i was meddling with my pen knife).Overall we are happy, but if you expect a neatly packaged product, they have a warnign on the picture or product description about the pieces shifting, so you shouldn't expect it, I did not but was shocked even with low expectations. My question to the manufacturer or seller is why, how difficult is it to have a box with a lid which has place holding indendations or some kind of pegs whic when closed would cover the small holes on the basde box and thereby prevent the tiny screws and nuts from scattering all over. I would imagine if you can get all these small stuff made wellm, then it should'nt be too hard for you to figure out a way to package them better.

I'm not a dentist, so I can't tell you the exact ion formulation that produces this feeling and gets the teeth clean, but suffice it to say that my mouth just feels fresh after I brush with this paste.Here's the way I view this product: Even on the nights I just want to roll into bed or roll out the door without brushing, this Crest toothpaste (due to its clean sensation and great taste) is one of those ""little things"" that make oral hygiene that much easier to set aside a little time for.","{0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0.4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0.75, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0.75, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1.1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1.55, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1.2965, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0.75, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0.65, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0.25, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0.85, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1.95, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0.45, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2.55, 0, 0, 4.65, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2.7, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0}",0.983,0.175,0.825,0,1,0,1006,185

I took barely ONE tablespoon and it worked within a few hours. The Flaxseed meal releases oils, the defatted chia bran is a fairly aggressive fiber, but the orange pulp and peel, full of natural anti-oxidants and bioflavoids is a key ingredient. Orange pulp is a digestive stimulant and encourages and increased the soft muscle contractions of the intestines, thus encouraging the forward movement of the bowel content. Orange pulp and peel is used in chinese medicine for the same thing - increasing digestion among other things.The taste is slightly strong (slightly bitter due to the orange peel) and it is a lot easier to get down than psyllium.

I tried several products and finally settled on this one after receiving a shave from my barber. This is what she used and it was great. Haven't looked back since.

We both go to the Chiropractor and have the Mediflow Waterbased pillows (see my review for those and the pillow case) but the addition of these 2 items was a great investment. We both suffer from neck and back pain and arthritis so we have tried many different things to help ease our pain and discomfort.My husband has used the NeckEase several times already and I used it the other night...heated it in the micro, wrapped it around my neck and climbed into bed for the night. Was very comfortable laying there with my head on my Mediflow Waterbased pillow and before I knew it I was fast asleep!I've used the Sinus Pillow twice now. We live in West TN and this time of year we can have some crazy weather - in the 70s one day and down to the 40s the next. This weather wreaks havoc on my sinuses, causing me lots of sinus pain and pressure and some pretty strong and painful, pounding headaches. I just heat my Sinus Pillow in the micro for the recommended time, lay down and place it over my eyes and nose and once again, it's not long until I'm fast asleep. Now, I'm not going to say it took my headache away completely each time, but it sure does relieve the sinus pressure and greatly reduces the pounding pain in my head so that I can relax and fall asleep quite easily. The various scents given off from each pillow is wonderful and very soothing.I would recommend both of these products and look forward to using them for years.

The investment in your health and comfort level is well worth the price. The polar fleece cover makes this warm and cozy, while the black cloth on the other side makes this pack radiate cold better when the pack is put in the freezer. So, you can use this in the winter or summer or anytime heat/cold is needed.To heat, put in the microwave for 2 to 3 minutes. To cool, keep in freezer until needed. You may want to put this in a plastic bag first if storing in the freezer.Over the years, the aromatic spices and herbs seem to retain their scent and the rice never seems to dry out, which is quite amazing.Ingredients: Rice, cinnamon, cloves, allspice and black pepper.This truly will relax tense shoulders when heated in the microwave.

Taking hormones are not an option for me; so I got on line to see what I could possibly take that was natural, that might help. While visiting Amazon site, I came across the NOW FOODS SUPER PRIMROSE. I read the reviews and decided to try them. Let me make it very clear that I don't write reviews, but I do read them. This product forced me to write this review in an effort to help some other women who are experiencing the hot flashes. I started using them exactly 18 days ago. My hot flashes have decreased substantially. I take two in the morning and two in the evening and feel like myself again.

We both go to the Chiropractor and have the Mediflow Waterbased pillows (see my review for those and the pillow case) but the addition of these 2 items was a great investment. We both suffer from neck and back pain and arthritis so we have tried many different things to help ease our pain and discomfort.My husband has used the NeckEase several times already and I used it the other night...heated it in the micro, wrapped it around my neck and climbed into bed for the night. Was very comfortable laying there with my head on my Mediflow Waterbased pillow and before I knew it I was fast asleep!I've used the Sinus Pillow twice now. We live in West TN and this time of year we can have some crazy weather - in the 70s one day and down to the 40s the next. This weather wreaks havoc on my sinuses, causing me lots of sinus pain and pressure and some pretty strong and painful, pounding headaches. I just heat my Sinus Pillow in the micro for the recommended time, lay down and place it over my eyes and nose and once again, it's not long until I'm fast asleep. Now, I'm not going to say it took my headache away completely each time, but it sure does relieve the sinus pressure and greatly reduces the pounding pain in my head so that I can relax and fall asleep quite easily. The various scents given off from each pillow is wonderful and very soothing.I would recommend both of these products and look forward to using them for years. And after reading the reviews of the BodySense Large Pack and Extra Large Pack I am putting those on my wishlist for purchase of one or both in the very near future!","{0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0.85, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 4.65, 0, 0, 0, -3.75, 0, 0, 0, 0, -3.45, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2.55, 2.25, 0, -3.45, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3.8895, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, -2.1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, -4.35, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, -3.45, 0, -1.8, 0, 0, 3.3, 3.45, 0, -2.85, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1.2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1.95, 0, 2.25, 0, 0, -1.8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, -3.45, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2.85, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2.5395, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 4.05, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2.64555, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0}",0.916,0.133,0.766,0.101,2,3,1761,332

The investment in your health and comfort level is well worth the price. The polar fleece cover makes this warm and cozy, while the black cloth on the other side makes this pack radiate cold better when the pack is put in the freezer. So, you can use this in the winter or summer or anytime heat/cold is needed.To heat, put in the microwave for 2 to 3 minutes. To cool, keep in freezer until needed. You may want to put this in a plastic bag first if storing in the freezer.Over the years, the aromatic spices and herbs seem to retain their scent and the rice never seems to dry out, which is quite amazing.Ingredients: Rice, cinnamon, cloves, allspice and black pepper.This truly will relax tense shoulders when heated in the microwave. Can also be used on lower back if you are laying in bed on your side because of the shape of the product.~The Rebecca Review","{0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1.5, 0, 0, 1.1, 0.9, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0.9, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1.9, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1.3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0.3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1.9, 0, 1.9, -1.4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, -1.2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0}",0.92,0.112,0.863,0.025,0,0,949,175

The investment in your health and comfort level is well worth the price. The polar fleece cover makes this warm and cozy, while the black cloth on the other side makes this pack radiate cold better when the pack is put in the freezer. So, you can use this in the winter or summer or anytime heat/cold is needed.To heat, put in the microwave for 2 to 3 minutes. To cool, keep in freezer until needed. You may want to put this in a plastic bag first if storing in the freezer.Over the years, the aromatic spices and herbs seem to retain their scent and the rice never seems to dry out, which is quite amazing.Ingredients: Rice, cinnamon, cloves, allspice and black pepper.This truly will relax tense shoulders when heated in the microwave.

"B000P9AR54","Gaia Herbs Eleuthero Root","83.10","AHD3NZHDUZ5I6","bdgilfry@wildchildpublishing.com ""Editor""",4,"So difficult to give an objective opinion...","I first heard of eleuthero as being an herb that can relieve joint pain. A lifetime of athletics and skiing has left my knees in something of a less than ideal state. So, I found a product here at Amazon called Good Earth ""Ginseng Green Tea"" with eleuthero (aka Siberian Ginseng).The tea helped. Within a few days, I experienced a little less swelling in my knees, much less pain, and greater agility.Thereafter, I sought a stronger source of eleuthero, and let me tell you, they abound on the internet. However, I wanted eleuthero in veggie caps. I don't eat meat, and most pills are bound with gelatin or sold in gelatin capsules. Gelatin, like the product Jell-o, consists mostly of what's left of an animal below the knees. The butcher grinds that up, cooks it, and there you have it: Jell-o! Not for me.This vegetarian requirement simplified the hunt, while simultaneously upping the price tremendously.I eventually bought a bottle of Eleuthero Root from ""gaia herbs"" here at Amazon. The product seems to be a paste or a liquid that is contained inside veggie capsules. So far, so good. The ""gaia herbs"" product seems to work well, although it is certainly expensive.Thereafter, when I stumbled upon a supply of Solgar eleuthero at the Vitamin Shoppe here on Amazon for only ten dollars, I had to give it a go.With ""gaia herbs"" you can trace the source of the herb and its freshness by a product code on the label. The same is not true of Solgar herbs, but a little research on the internet told me that Solgar is a respected name among herb sellers and buyers.The Eleuthero Root from ""gaia herbs"" is packaged in a bottle of 60, and sells for about $20 per bottle (or about $17 if you subscribe through Amazon Prime). As two capsules are the recommended dosage (about 800 mg), this is a 30-day supply.Thus: With the product from ""gaia herbs"", we have a 30-day supply for $20, or about $.67 a day.The Solgar product is actually packaged in bottles of 100 (although the website claims 250), and in capsules of 510 mg, a dose that Solgar claims is the daily recommended dosage.Thus, the Solgar product constitutes a 100-day supply for around $11, eleven cents a day; or if you choose to double up, a 50-day supply at twenty-two cents a day.Further, the Solgar product is in powder form, enabling the consumer to open the capsule and pour the product directly into tea, juice, or a power drink (or a vodka gimlet, I suppose).Research into the value of eleuthero is limited, and while there is some indication that regular ingestion of eleuthero may produce a number of benefits, no one has demonstrated this other than anecdotally.I feel a benefit from the regular use of eleuthero, and I've been using it in one form or another for over a year now. Two months ago, I bought a mountain bike, and I am able to ride 20 miles a day now -- in fact, last night, I clocked 25 miles before heading home.I can tell you two things for certain:1. My knees feel better to me, and2. my knees have improved in strength and reduced pain during the period when I was taking a daily dose of eleuthero.What I cannot say for certain is that the improvement in my knees is because of the eleuthero. Nevertheless, I am not willing to discontinue its use.As to trying to distinguish between the quality of the two products that have been the subject of this review, I cannot. I take both of them alternately.I believe I am healthier from the regular use of eleuthero, but my beliefs cannot affect your life. Only your beliefs can do that.It all comes down to this: Placebo-wise or otherwise, if it feels good, do it.","{0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0.75, 0, -1.15, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1.060825, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0.35, 0, 0.95, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, -1.0035, 0, 0.61815, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0.8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0.75, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0.35, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1.22835, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0.55, 0, 0, 0, 0.7, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0.6, 0, 0, 0, 0.35, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, -0.666, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3.15, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1.05, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1.2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1.2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2.1, 0, 0, 0, -1.35, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0.45, 0, 2.4, -1.8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2.85, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3.15, 0, 3.3, 0, 0, -3.45, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, -1.221, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2.85, 0, 0}",0.991,0.094,0.88,0.026,2,1,3596,650

I take this when I start to get that little tickle in the back of my throat, or feel any semblance to a cold or flu symptom. This is one of 2 products I keep on hand at all times.

Cuthbertson ""Outnumbered (4 boys!)""",3,"Pros and cons in arthritis relief","I am in my 30's and have had arthritis for almost 14 years. Over the last couple of years, the pain in my hands has become more disruptive, and I've tried several things in my search for relief. Prescription medications (oral), OTC topical creams, heated wraps and gloves (both compression and non-compression). I purchased two of these Futuro Energizing Support gloves and have been mostly satisfied...but not completely.As you can see from the product image, these gloves do not cover the fingers at all, and therefore the ""warmth"" benefit is limited to the palm of the hand. This is better than nothing, of course. There is certainly a benefit from the compression provided by the glove, but once again, this is limited to the wrist and the palm of the hand.On the plus side, the gloves are reversible -- able to be worn on either hand. I find I am not able to wear them for long periods of time, however...the piece that goes between the index and middle finger becomes uncomfortable and I find myself tugging at it. Also, the velcro strap that wraps around the wrist is quick to snag and pull at the fabric of the glove if you aren't careful. (Although I am quite careful to keep the strap fastened to itself even when I'm not wearing the gloves, I've got a couple of unsightly pulls on each glove.)I can recommend these gloves when you are looking for some compression (as long as you don't care about coverage for the fingers), and they are definitely great for wrist support thanks to the velcro strap, but I prefer the IMAK Arthritis gloves in general. Keep the Futuro gloves as a back up pair.","{0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, -1.15, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, -0.7965, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1.05, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0.85, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 0, -0.45, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1.1, 0, 0, 0.95, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0.7, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, -1.35, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, -1.8, 0, 0, 3.3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, -2.4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, -0.666, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1.3395, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2.25, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, -2.442, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2.55, 4.65, 0, 0, 2.55, 2.85, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0}",0.975,0.136,0.806,0.059,2,0,1603,290

I have to routinely grade many papers, so writing a lot is necessary. During those times, the tendonitis in my hand gets pretty bad, it's painful to even hold a fork, and on the worst days I can feel it all the time even when I'm not holding something.I've tried many things--more ergonomic set-ups, different kids of pens, other braces, hand stretches, but this has worked best of all. It allows full hand motion unlike the thick braces.Perhaps I'm lucky that my hand size is good for this glove/brace. It puts a good amount of pressure on my palms. I'm unfamiliar with the biology behind the pain, but that ""squeeze"" seems to work, especially when combined with a little Icy Hot balm (don't use the cream or gel with it as it's too messy). The glove is stretchy and could probably accommodate a range of hand sizes, but I imagine that if your hand is too small or exactly in the middle of two sizes, it might not work well. Give it a try though.The only complaint I have is that the part in between the index finger and palm has a tendency to stretch and become thinner, even if the rest of the glove/brace doesn't stretch that much. As a result, you will have to replace your glove regularly if you use it often.Still, the price of the glove is nothing compared to the benefits that it brings and the ability it's given me to grade so many papers without pain.","{0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1.1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, -0.2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1.1, 0, 1.1, -1.25, 0, -0.95, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, -1.55, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1.1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 4.8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3.3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2.7, 0, 0, 3.3, 0, 0, 2.85, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2.85, 0, 0, -1.8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, -3.45, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, -2.25, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3.3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3.3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, -1.221, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, -1.8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2.4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1.95, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2.553}",0.986,0.163,0.765,0.072,3,0,1471,276

We both go to the Chiropractor and have the Mediflow Waterbased pillows (see my review for those and the pillow case) but the addition of these 2 items was a great investment. We both suffer from neck and back pain and arthritis so we have tried many different things to help ease our pain and discomfort.My husband has used the NeckEase several times already and I used it the other night...heated it in the micro, wrapped it around my neck and climbed into bed for the night. Was very comfortable laying there with my head on my Mediflow Waterbased pillow and before I knew it I was fast asleep!I've used the Sinus Pillow twice now. We live in West TN and this time of year we can have some crazy weather - in the 70s one day and down to the 40s the next. This weather wreaks havoc on my sinuses, causing me lots of sinus pain and pressure and some pretty strong and painful, pounding headaches. I just heat my Sinus Pillow in the micro for the recommended time, lay down and place it over my eyes and nose and once again, it's not long until I'm fast asleep.

The investment in your health and comfort level is well worth the price. The polar fleece cover makes this warm and cozy, while the black cloth on the other side makes this pack radiate cold better when the pack is put in the freezer. So, you can use this in the winter or summer or anytime heat/cold is needed.To heat, put in the microwave for 2 to 3 minutes. To cool, keep in freezer until needed. You may want to put this in a plastic bag first if storing in the freezer.Over the years, the aromatic spices and herbs seem to retain their scent and the rice never seems to dry out, which is quite amazing.Ingredients: Rice, cinnamon, cloves, allspice and black pepper.This truly will relax tense shoulders when heated in the microwave. Can also be used on lower back if you are laying in bed on your side because of the shape of the product.~The Rebecca Review","{0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1.5, 0, 0, 1.1, 0.9, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0.9, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1.9, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1.3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0.3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1.9, 0, 1.9, -1.4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, -1.2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0}",0.92,0.112,0.863,0.025,0,0,949,175

I have always strongly wanted to exclusively breastfeed him. We saw lactation consultants several times and by all accounts everything was fine - our son just wouldn't gain weight. At our two month checkup with our pediatrician, he was still below birth weight. Even though I didn't necessarily have a supply issue, our pro-breasfeeding pediatrician suggested I try MotherLove to see what happens. I bought the tincture and while the taste was shockingly unpleasant at first, I have definitely gotten used to it. I can't say that I noticed a HUGE increase in supply, but I did feel it made a difference. Four weeks later, we confirmed my suspicion with a weight check, and our son had gained 11 ounces in those four weeks. That's more than the previous 8 weeks combined. It COULD be coincidence, but I can't help but think that MotherLove More Milk Plus increased my supply just enough to meet the growing needs of our son.

With this, I dont even get the ""maple syrup smell"" that you are supposed to get (this is how you know you are taking enough and it is active in your system).Another review suggested that this product seems to work better for skinny moms below 175, maybe that is the case, because it didn't work for me either.I will be switching back to Fenugreek today. What a waste of $30!!!!Maybe the health food store I bought it from will allow me to return it? Who knows.","{0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0.35, 0, 0, 0, 1.8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, -4.1895, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1.35, 0, 1.65, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, -2.7, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2.55, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2.85, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2.55, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2.85, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, -2.7, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1.35, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0}",0.917,0.112,0.837,0.051,3,5,1118,221
